The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the “heterogeneity” in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.   

1. Introduction 

Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1–5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, e.g., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, etc. [6–11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12–15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called ‘percolation threshold’ [16–18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19–21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22–24]. 

The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25–27]. 
Luo et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28–32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (λ⊥) of 5.5 W/m⋅K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
but a high λ⊥ of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (e.g., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ//) and a limited λ⊥ [33–35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the λ⊥ of the composites [36]. 

For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37–40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 

date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical “probe” detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials and sample preparation 

Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 μm and a thickness of 
~0.26 μm (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 μm is purchased from Ya’an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 ◦C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 ◦C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 ◦C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 

2.2. Characterizations 

The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 ◦C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 ◦C to 650 ◦C in a N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 ◦C 
with 10 ◦C/min from 30 ◦C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate 
thermal history. Then, the samples were cooled to 30 ◦C at a heating rate 
of 10 ◦C/min, followed by heating again to 220 ◦C.

The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 ◦C oven for 4 h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-Kα ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 Å. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5–50 o. 

3. Results 

To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ⊥), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 

The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 ◦C. Fig. 2a–d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, i.e., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The λ⊥
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both λ⊥ at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent λ⊥ (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m⋅K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m⋅K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 

As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (Tm) and crystallinity (Xc) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: Tm = 166.4 ◦C, Xc = 29.6%; the distal end: Tm = 166.9 ◦C, Xc =

28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 

To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of λ⊥ and the 

heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5◦ is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 

To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in λ⊥ and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, L1/L2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of L1/L2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of L1/L2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

Notably, the value of L1/L2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 

flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and λ⊥) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 

In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a–d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the λ⊥ of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the “dilution” 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of λ⊥ between the proximal and distal position (Δλ⊥/λ⊥) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The Δλ⊥/λ⊥ values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will “disturb” 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites. 

4. Discussion 

In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44–48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a “cold” 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 

During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly “freezes” when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 

During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

platelets within PP/FG composites.

FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 

The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm–8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(e.g., injection pressure, mold temperature, etc.) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future. 

5. Conclusion 

In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.

The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the “heterogeneity” in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.   

1. Introduction 

Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1–5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, e.g., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, etc. [6–11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12–15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called ‘percolation threshold’ [16–18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19–21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22–24]. 

The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25–27]. 
Luo et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28–32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (λ⊥) of 5.5 W/m⋅K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
but a high λ⊥ of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (e.g., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ//) and a limited λ⊥ [33–35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the λ⊥ of the composites [36]. 

For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37–40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 

date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical “probe” detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials and sample preparation 

Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 μm and a thickness of 
~0.26 μm (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 μm is purchased from Ya’an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 ◦C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 ◦C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 ◦C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 

2.2. Characterizations 

The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 ◦C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 ◦C to 650 ◦C in a N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 ◦C 
with 10 ◦C/min from 30 ◦C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate 
thermal history. Then, the samples were cooled to 30 ◦C at a heating rate 
of 10 ◦C/min, followed by heating again to 220 ◦C.

The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 ◦C oven for 4 h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-Kα ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 Å. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5–50 o. 

3. Results 

To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ⊥), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 

The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 ◦C. Fig. 2a–d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, i.e., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The λ⊥
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both λ⊥ at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent λ⊥ (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m⋅K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m⋅K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 

As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (Tm) and crystallinity (Xc) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: Tm = 166.4 ◦C, Xc = 29.6%; the distal end: Tm = 166.9 ◦C, Xc =

28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 

To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of λ⊥ and the 

heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5◦ is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 

To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in λ⊥ and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, L1/L2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of L1/L2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of L1/L2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

Notably, the value of L1/L2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 

flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and λ⊥) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 

In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a–d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the λ⊥ of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the “dilution” 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of λ⊥ between the proximal and distal position (Δλ⊥/λ⊥) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The Δλ⊥/λ⊥ values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will “disturb” 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites. 

4. Discussion 

In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44–48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a “cold” 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 

During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly “freezes” when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 

During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 

The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm–8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(e.g., injection pressure, mold temperature, etc.) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future. 

5. Conclusion 

In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.

The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the “heterogeneity” in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.   

1. Introduction 

Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1–5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, e.g., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, etc. [6–11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12–15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called ‘percolation threshold’ [16–18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19–21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22–24]. 

The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25–27]. 
Luo et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28–32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (λ⊥) of 5.5 W/m⋅K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
but a high λ⊥ of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (e.g., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ//) and a limited λ⊥ [33–35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the λ⊥ of the composites [36]. 

For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37–40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 

date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical “probe” detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials and sample preparation 

Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 μm and a thickness of 
~0.26 μm (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 μm is purchased from Ya’an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 ◦C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 ◦C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 ◦C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 

2.2. Characterizations 

The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 ◦C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 ◦C to 650 ◦C in a N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 ◦C 
with 10 ◦C/min from 30 ◦C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate

of 10 ◦C/min, followed by heating again to 220 ◦C.

The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 ◦C oven for 4 h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-Kα ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 Å. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5–50 o. 

3. Results 

To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ⊥), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 

The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 ◦C. Fig. 2a–d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, i.e., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The λ⊥
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both λ⊥ at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent λ⊥ (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m⋅K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m⋅K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 

As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (Tm) and crystallinity (Xc) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: Tm = 166.4 ◦C, Xc = 29.6%; the distal end: Tm = 166.9 ◦C, Xc =

28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 

To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of λ⊥ and the 

heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5◦ is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 

To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in λ⊥ and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, L1/L2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of L1/L2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of L1/L2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

Notably, the value of L1/L2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 

flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and λ⊥) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 

In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a–d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the λ⊥ of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the “dilution” 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of λ⊥ between the proximal and distal position (Δλ⊥/λ⊥) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The Δλ⊥/λ⊥ values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will “disturb” 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites. 

4. Discussion 

In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44–48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a “cold” 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 

During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly “freezes” when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 

During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

platelets within PP/FG composites.

FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 

The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm–8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(e.g., injection pressure, mold temperature, etc.) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future. 

5. Conclusion 

In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.

Decreased Thermal Conductivity
of Polyethylene Chain Influenced
by Short Chain Branching
In this paper, we have studied the effect of short branches (side chains) on the thermal
conductivity (TC) of a polyethylene (PE) chain. With a reverse nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics (RNEMD) method, TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are
simulated and compared. It shows that the branch has a positive effect to decrease the
TC of a PE chain. The TC of the PE-ethyl chain decreases with the number density
increase of branches, until the density becomes larger than about eight ethyl per 200 seg-
ments, where the TC saturates to be only about 40% that of a pristine PE chain. Because
of different weights, different branches will cause a different decrease of TCs, and a
heavy branch will lead to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

1 Introduction

Not only a high thermal conductivity (TC) but also a quite low
TC is desired for polymers because of their wide applications
[1–6], such as a high TC for application as a thermal interface
material [7,8] and a low TC for application as a thermal insulation
material. Single polymer chains and highly aligned polymer fibers
have attracted a wide attention due to their potential high TC
[9–16]. Although a single polymer chain may possess a high TC,
polymers are generally regarded as a thermal insulator because of
their very low thermal conductivities on the order of 0.1 W m1 K1 [17]. One of the reasons for the low TC is that the polymer
chains are randomly coiled in the polymers, which effectively
shortens the mean free path (MFP) of heat-carrying phonons
[18,19]. Another reason is that the TC of these polymers can be
significantly influenced by the morphology of individual chains
[14–17,20–22]. Besides these two reasons, the method to further
decrease the TC of a polymer is still desired to develop a thermal
insulator.

There have already been some methods to reduce the TC of a
polymer chain. Liao et al. [23] tuned the TC of a polymer chain
by atomic mass modifications and found that heavy substituents
hinder heat transport substantially. Robbins and Minnich [16]found that even perfectly crystalline polynorbornene has an
exceptionally low TC near the amorphous limit due to extremely
strong anharmonic scattering. Most recently, Ma and Tian [24]studied the influence of the side chains on the TC of bottlebrush
polymers, and predicted that side chains dominate the heat con-
duction and could lead to a lower TC. Some other studies also
shown that chain segment disorder, or the random rotations of
segments in a chain, will lead to a lower TC [15,25–28].

In this paper, we take the effect of branches into account to
probe a way to reduce the TC of a polymer. Considering the com-
plex structure of a polymer, we just focus on the polyethylene
(PE) chain. Results turn out that the TC of a PE chain with
branches can be decreased to be only 40% that of a pristine chain.
The paper is organized as follows: first, a reverse nonequilibrium

molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method is introduced; and then
the effects of backbone chain length, branching chain location,
branching chain type, and the number density of branching chains
are simulated and discussed. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

2 Simulation Method

The materials studio is applied to build the initial configuration
of the PE chain and the modified PE chain. The PE chain is estab-
lished by replicating the PE segments which is the unit cell of
PE’s idealized bulk lattice structure with a length of 2.507 Å. The
schematic structures of a pristine PE chain and a PE-ethyl chain
are shown in Fig. 1. After building the PE chain, with the COM-
PASS II potential [29–32], we first relax the system in an NVT
(constant number of atoms, temperature, and volume) ensemble at
a temperature of 300 K for 125 ps, where the Nose–Hoover ther-
mostat [33,34] is applied to obtain the constant temperature. And
then, a NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy)
ensemble is used to release the thermal stress. In the simulation
process, we double-check that the total energy has reached mini-
mum and becomes unchangeable at the end of NVT and NVE
ensembles to make sure that our systems have already been
equilibrated.

To calculate TC, the RNEMD [35,36] simulation is performed
on the well equilibrated structures to establish a temperature gra-
dient. In the RNEMD method, each of the simulation boxes is
divided into several slabs with a periodic boundary in the heat
transfer direction. As that shown in Fig. 2, the simulation system
is divided into several slabs (20 to 200 slabs, depending on the
chain length), slab 0 is the “hot” slab, and the slab N/2 is the
“cold” slab. Other slabs are used to obtain the temperature distri-
butions. The heat flux is created by exchanging velocities of par-
ticles in cold and hot slabs. The cold slab donates its “hottest”
particles (particles with the highest kinetic energy) to the hot slab
in exchange for the latter’s “coolest” particles (particles with the
lowest kinetic energy). Performing this exchange periodically
results in the heating up of the hot slab and cooling down of the
cold slab. This process eventually yields a steady-state tempera-
ture gradient due to thermal conduction through slabs separating
the cold and hot slabs. The TC is calculated exactly by the
relationship

the cross-sectional area which is selected to be 14.7 Å2 with a
branch-caused uncertainty less than 1.6% as listed in Table 1.Such a small difference between cross-sectional areas will not
lead to a large TC difference as that caused by branches (will be
discussed later). The TC present in this work could be scaled by a
different cross-sectional area for a comparison. With a time-step

of 1 fs, a total simulation time of 0.1 ns is taken to get a good lin-
ear temperature distribution. The temperature which is adopted to
calculate the temperature gradient is averaged through every 1000simulation steps (1 ps). The temperature fluctuation in the simula-
tion can be reduced by this average method. With heat flux printed
out every 0.1 ps, the TC is calculated at the last step. The tempera-
ture distribution in a PE chain with a length of 100 segments is
shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The linear temperature region is
fitted to obtain the temperature gradient for the calculation of the
effective TC by using the Fourier’s law. The TC calculated at dif-
ferent simulation times is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that 0.1 ns is
long enough to get a converged TC.

3 Results and Discussion

First, the length dependence of the TC of a pristine PE chain is
investigated and compared with that in early researches. And
then, the TC of the pristine PE chains with different lengths is
compared with that of a PE-ethyl chain. Third, the effect of the
branch arrangement is considered. Finally, the influence of the
branch type and the number density of branches are taken into
account.

3.1 Length Dependence of TC. Thermal conductivities of
the pristine PE chain with different chain lengths at 300 K are first
simulated and presented in Fig. 4(a). Previous works [14,37,38]about the pristine PE chains are also added in Fig. 4(a) for com-
parison. As that shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an obvious increase of
the TC with the increase of the chain length. Even with the length
increasing to be 200 nm, the TC still not converges, which sug-
gests that some portion of the phonons can still travel ballistically

in such a length. Our simulation work confirms that the TC of a
pristine PE chain will increase with the increasing number of seg-
ments (or chain length), and the TC of a single PE chain is several
orders of magnitude larger than that of a PE polymer. In Fig. 4(a),
the TC difference between different works should be attributed to
the application of different simulation methods, considering that
the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method is applied in our
and the work of Hu et al. and the equilibrium molecular dynamics
method is utilized in the work of Ni et al. and Liu and Yang. It
seems that a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method will
give a higher TC than an equilibrium molecular dynamics method.
This was also noticed in other studies [39,40], and some explana-
tions can be found there.

Plotting 1/k against 1/L in Fig. 4(b), we can see that with the
increase of 1/L, the 1/k first increases rapidly and then saturates to
a linear increase. The method by extrapolating the linear relation-
ship between the inverse of the TC (1/k) and the inverse of the
sample length (1/L) to get the TC with an infinite length fails.
This failure is attributed to the divergent thermal conductivity at
1/L! 0 where 1/k! 0, which has already been carefully studied
and explained with theoretical and molecular dynamics methods
in Ref. [41], more details can be found there.

Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain and the PE-
ethyl chain with lengths ranging from 100 to 500 segments (or
25.07–125.35 nm) are compared in Fig. 5. It turns out that both
TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain increase with
the increasing length, and the TC of a PE-ethyl chain is only about
75% that of a pristine PE chain. To illustrate the underlying mech-
anism of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain, the vibrational den-
sity of states (VDOS) is calculated by using the Fourier transform

of the velocity autocorrelation function. Results are compared
between the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain with 50 seg-
ments, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering the low-frequency
(<20 THz) phonons dominate the TC due to their high group
velocities and long MFPs [23], the lower VDOS of the PE-ethyl
chain in the low frequency should be responsible for the lower
TC, where the branch acts as a center of low-frequency-phonon
scattering.

To further illustrate the phonon scattering caused by the branch-
ing chains, the phonon spectral energy density (SED) of the pris-
tine PE and PE-ethyl chains is calculated based on the velocity
output of MD simulations. The atomic velocities are obtained by a
NVE simulation at a temperature of 300 K. The frequency resolu-
tion is selected to be 0.01 THz with 0.1 ns NVE simulations, and
the wave-number is 0.02j/(2p/a), where j¼ 2pn/aN, here a is the
lattice constant, N is the total number of unit cells along the heat
transfer direction (N¼ 50 in this work), and n is an integer ranging
from 0 to N 1. More details about the calculation can be found
in Refs. [42–45]. Results are shown in Fig. 7 with the shading sig-
nifying the magnitude of the SED. The SED of a pristine PE chain
in Fig. 7(a) coincides with that in Ref. [16] which confirms the
reliability of our calculation. For each phonon mode in Fig. 7, the
range of frequencies is related to the anharmonicity of the poten-
tial and the rate of the phonon scattering. The situation when
branch atoms move far away from equilibrium positions may lead
to a significant broadening of the peaks in Fig. 7. Fitting the shape
of peak and valley profiles of SED at all branches to the Lorent-
zian function [42–45], the phonon relaxation time is obtained and
shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the magnitude of the phonon relaxa-
tion time is greatly reduced by branching chains, which should be

responsible for the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain. The redistribu-
tion of phonons and the smearing acoustic branches of the
PE-ethyl chain in Fig. 7(b) proves the result in Fig. 8 that there is
a more severe phonon scattering for a PE-ethyl chain than a pris-
tine PE chain.

3.2 Influence of Branch Arrangements. The influence of
branch locations is considered in this part. For a pristine PE chain,
there are different locations from the simulation region boundary
to the branching ethyl. Five special locations are selected to
branch a short chain, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respec-
tively, as that shown in Fig. 9(a). The result in Fig. 9(b) confirms
that the presence of a branching chain can truly reduce the TC,
and the average TC of a PE-ethyl chain is about 0.7 times that of a
pristine PE chain. Our simulations also indicate that there is
almost a same TC for different locations in Fig. 9(b). This is
attributed to the periodic boundary condition in the simulation.
The small TC discrepancies between different locations should be
caused by the different distance of the branch from the simulation
boundary. If the boundary and the branching chains are both
thought as defects on a pristine PE chain, the TC with ethyl
located at the middle of the chain (P1) will be lower than other
TCs (P2, P3, P4, and P5), because of the small distance from the

middle of the chain to the system boundary. This is confirmed by
results in Fig. 9(b).

3.3 Influence of Branching Chain Types and Number Den-
sity of Branches. Seven different types of short chains are
branched on the middle segment of a PE chain, respectively, for
comparisons. They are different from the weight and the type of
chemical bonds between the backbone and the branch, as shown
in Fig. 10, which are listed as phenoxy group, phenyl group,
ethoxy group, methoxy group, ethyl group, ethylene group, and
hydroxy group, respectively. The black, red, and blue columns in
Fig. 10 stand for different chain lengths. The relative masses of
different branches are also shown in Fig. 10. We can see that all
types of branches can lead to a decrease of TC, and a heavy
branch leads to a lower TC than a light one, except for the ethyl-
ene group for which TC may be further decreased by a different
bond. It agrees with the conclusion in Ref. [23] that a chain modi-
fied by a heave atom possesses a lower TC than that modified by a
light one, where the modifying atom can be thought a special
short branch. We conclude that different branches will lead to a
different decrease of thermal conductivities because of the differ-
ent weights. More studies are still needed to probe the effect of
bonds between the backbone and the branch on the TC.

The effect of the number density of branches is studied in this
part. The number density of branches is defined as the number of
branches divided by the number of PE segments. Two hundred
segments (50.14 nm) are applied as a periodic unit in the simula-
tion, and the ethyl group is selected as the branch. Considering
there are different locations on a PE chain to branch an ethyl
group, we only consider two special location arrangements, i.e.,
the aligned arrangement and the fork arrangement, as that shown
in Fig. 11(a). For the aligned arrangement of ten branching ethyl,
they are equally distributed on the PE chain, only a part of the
chain is shown in Fig. 11(a); for the fork arrangement of ten
branching ethyl, every two branching ethyl are located at the same
segment of the PE chain, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). The corre-
sponding TC of these two arrangements is shown in Fig. 11(b). It
shows that a larger number density of branches leads to a lower
TC for both arrangements. With an increase of the number density
of branches, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain finally converges to be
only about 40% that of the pristine PE chain. This can be under-
stood by that with the increase of the number density, the distance
between branches is reduced, and the long-MFP phonons will be
decreased until the TC converges to a constant value. It can be
predicted that if a PE-ethyl chain instead of a pristine PE chain is
used to build up a polymer, the TC of the polymer will be much
reduced, because of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain and the
additional mass of branches. What kind of a chain will lead to a
lower TC is the key point of this paper, and more studies are still
needed to figure out the effect of long branches on the TC of a
pristine chain [24].

4 Conclusions

It is desirable to further reduce the TC of a polymer for devel-
oping a thermal insulation material. In this paper, we take
branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a chain.
With the RNEMD method, the TCs of the pristine PE chain and
the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. Influences of the
chain length, branch arrangements, types, and number density of
branches are considered. Our results suggest that the branch has a
positive effect to reduce the TC of a PE chain. If the number den-
sity of ethyl branches becomes larger than eight ethyls per 200segments, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain converges to be only about
40% that of a pristine PE chain. This conclusion will not be influ-
enced by the branch arrangements. Different branches cause a dif-
ferent decrease of thermal conductivities because of their different
weights, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one.
This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to
obtain a polymer with a low TC.

Nature 2018 ABSTRACT

The crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers and molecular orientation of

polymer have long been considered to be significant influencing factors on the

thermal conductivity of polymer materials, but more clear-cut understanding on

their impact on the thermal conductivity is still needed. In this work, poly-L-

lactide (PLLA), whose crystallinity and orientation can be adjusted in a wide

range, is selected to discuss the effect of degree of crystallinity and orientation

on the thermal conductivity of PLLA. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature

on the thermal conductivity is also discussed. PLLA compression-molded

samples were heat-treated at 120 C to tune the crystallinity of the samples,

while the degrees of orientation were tuned by stretching the amorphous PLLA

bars at 60 C to different strains. It is found that environmental temperature of

application affects the thermal conductivity obviously and the glass transition

temperature of polymers shows a strong influence on the thermal conductivity

of PLLA. Below Tg, the thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature and when the temperature is higher than Tg, the

thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity decreases remarkably.

It is also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of PLLA increases with the

increase in crystallinity, and the tensile strain linearly increases the thermal

conductivity in the direction of molecular orientation and decreases the thermal

conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which are in agreement with other

semicrystalline polymers that has been reported.

Introduction

With the rapid development of science and tech-

nologies, electric products are more and more highly

integrated, which urgently pushes the exploitation of

effective thermal management materials including

thermally conductive polymers and polymer com-

posites to be applied in various applications [1–7],

such as packaging, electronic devices and energy

storage. However, bulk polymers generally exhibit

very low thermal conductivity (TC) in the range of

0.1–0.5 W/(mK) [8, 9], so the development of poly-

mer materials with enhanced thermal conductivity

has become a great challenge to meet great increasing

demands [10–15]. It has been accepted that the

polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the overall TC

of polymer composites [16]. It is therefore necessary

to clearly clarify the influence of important factors

such as crystallinity and molecular orientation on the

TC of polymers.

Generally, crystalline polymers exhibit higher TC

than amorphous polymers due to the ordered struc-

ture, while the random chain conformation in amor-

phous polymers reduces the phonon mean free path

and causes phonon scattering [17]. In early study,

Hansen et al. [18] reported that the TC of high density

polyethylene can be improved by increasing the

crystallinity and lamellar thickness via tuning pro-

cessing conditions. Subsequently, Choy and co-

worker [19] found that the influence of crystallinity

on the TC of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was

affected by temperature. The TC of PET decreases

with increasing crystallinity at low temperature, but

increases with crystallinity at temperatures above

30 K. The peculiar behavior was interpreted from the

increasing thermal boundary resistance due to

acoustic mismatch at amorphous–crystalline interface

when the temperature is lowered. Crystallization was

also reported to be responsible for the higher TC in

other semicrystalline polymers [20, 21]. The higher

the crystallinity, the higher the thermal conductivity.

As heat transports more easily along polymer

chains than perpendicular to the polymer chain,

polymers exhibit significant anisotropy in their ther-

mally conductive properties [22]. Numerous experi-

mental studies on polymer chain orientation for TC

enhancement have been reported. As a typical

semicrystalline polymer, polyethylene (PE) has been

mostly used to study the effect of orientation on TC

[18, 23–28]. TC of other semicrystalline polymers

stretched to different draw ratio including poly-

oxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP),

polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET was also

studied [29]. The general result is that TC parallel to

the orientation direction rapidly increases with

increasing strain or draw ratio, while TC perpendic-

ular to the orientation direction decreases slightly.

But in these studies on the effect of the orientation,

TC was also influenced by the crystallization nature

of the polymers. To clarify how chain alignment

affects TC during drawing, purely amorphous poly-

mers were studied [30–34]. Early studies [31, 32] showed that the TC of stretched polymethyl

methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can be

increased in the stretching direction, but the increase

was small. However, it was found recently that

polythiophene nanofibers can achieve a TC up to

4.4 W/(m K), more than 20 times greater than the

bulk polymer through chain alignment [34]. Lu et al.

[35] also evidenced the molecular alignment in

amorphous region played a very important role in

the enhancement of thermal conductivity of

semicrystalline polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber.

PLLA is a plant-derived biodegradable polymer

material. However, low thermal conductivity restricts

its application in engineering and electronic fields. To

expand the applications of PLLA, many studies have

been conducted to improve the TC of PLLA via

compounding with thermally conductive fillers

[36–41], but the basic influencing factors from the

polymer itself have not been well addressed, which is

hopefully to provide supporting for fabrication of

high thermally conductive PLLA composites. Also,

owing to that PLLA exhibits very low crystallization

kinetics [42–44], the amorphous state by quenching

and a wide range of degrees of crystallinity by

isothermal crystallization at different temperature for

different periods of time can be easily achieved [45].

These features provide a good candidate to elucidate

the effect of crystallinity and molecular orientation on

the TC of semicrystalline polymers.

In this study, the crystallinity of PLLA was tuned

by melt crystallization at 120 C for different minutes.

Various degrees of orientation of PLLA were realized

by stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C with

the same speed to different strains. WAXD was car-

ried out to characterize the crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA. DSC, density measurement and

laser flash method were performed together to reveal

10544 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 the relation between TC and crystallinity, tempera-

ture and orientation of molecular chains. The results

showed that TC of PLLA with different crystallinity

was affected obviously by ambient temperature and

the maximum value appeared at Tg. TC of PLLA

increases with increasing crystallinity, and TC of

PLLA parallel to the orientation direction increases

with increasing tensile strain, while the one perpen-

dicular to the stretching direction decreases with

increasing strain. These results can further manifest

the effect of crystallinity and orientation on the

thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers.

Also, this systematic study can provide supporting

for fabricating enhanced thermally conductive PLLA

composites.

Experimental section

Materials and sample preparation

PLLA (trade name 4032D, Nature Works LLC) was

used. The average weight molecular weight (Mw) and

the polydispersity index (PDI) are 2.1 9 105 g/mol

and 1.7. The melting temperature is 167.2 C, mea-

sured by differential scanning calorimetry at a heat-

ing rate of 10 C/min.

PLLA granules were dried in a blast drying oven at

60 C for 12 h, and then melted in the mixer of a

torque rheometer with a rotational speed of 50 rpm at

190 C for 5 min. After that, the resulted materials

were compressed into sheets with the thickness of

about 0.5 mm at 190 C for 3 min under a pressure of

10 MPa. The melted PLLA sheet was immediately

transferred to isothermal crystallization at 120 C for

different minutes (0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 40 min)

under a pressure of 10 MPa and then cooled quickly

to obtain samples with different crystallinity. The

resulted samples were designated as 120-X min, in

which X stands for the compression time at 120 C.
Round disks with the diameter of 12.7 mm were cut

from the 120-X min PLLA sheets for WAXD and

thermal diffusivity tests. Rectangular-shaped sample

bars with the dimension of 20 mm (width) 9 80.0 mm (length) were cut from amorphous 120-0 min

PLLA sheets, and then stretched uniaxially at 60 C
using an Instron 5967 universal material testing

machine at a stretching rate of 20 mm/min. The

tensile strain was controlled to be 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The stretched bars designated as 60-20-Y, in which

Y stands for the tensile strain, were measured by 2D wide angel X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to determine

the degree orientation. Both the through-plane and

in-plane thermal diffusivities of the stretched bars

were tested.

Characterization

WAXD measurements and data analysis

WAXD measurement of PLLA compression sheets

isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different min-

utes was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffrac-

tometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k = 0.154 nm,

40 kV, 25 mA) in the scanning range of 2h = 5–60 at
a scan speed of 10/min at room temperature. The

crystallinity was determined from the fractional area

of the crystalline peaks to the total area [46].

WAXD measurement of PLLA samples stretched to

different strains at 60 C with the speed of 20 mm/

min was carried out on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER 2D X-ray diffractometer with the reflection mode. The

X-ray was generated using ImS micro Focus X-ray

source generator with Cu target (k = 0.154 nm, 40 kV,

40 mA). The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns were

recorded on a VANTEC-500 detector system with a

pixel size of 68 9 68 mm2. The distance from the

sample to detector was 198 mm. The spot size of the

beam was 0.5 mm.

Density measurement

The density of PLLA compression-molded samples

with different crystallinity was measured by using

MH-120E density meter according to Archimedes

principle.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement

The empty pan, sapphire standard and PLLA com-

pression-molded samples with different crystallinity

were measured by DSC (Q20, TA company). Samples

were measured from - 80 to 90 C with heating rate

of 10 C/min under nitrogen gas flow of 50 mL/min.

Thermal conductivity measurement by laser flash method

The sample preparation processes for the thermal

diffusivity measurements are outlined in Fig. S1. Before testing, the thickness and length or diameter

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10545 of the samples were measured, and then both sur-

faces of the samples were evenly sprayed with a thin

graphite layer. The sample was then fixed according

to the required test pattern and placed in the test

chamber (LFA 467, Netzsch). PLLA compression-

molded samples with different crystallinity were

tested in the temperature ranging from - 70 to 80 C,
while the PLLA stretched samples with different

degree of orientation were tested at 25 C.

Results and discussion

Effect of temperature and crystallinity
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

WAXD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sam-

ples isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different

period of time are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that

the quenched PLLA compression-molded sample

without isothermal crystallization (120-0 min) shows

only a very broad diffraction peak of amorphous

phase without any traces of crystalline peaks, clearly

showing the amorphous nature of the sample owing

to the extremely slow crystallization kinetics of

PLLA. After isothermal crystallizing at 120 C, the
WAXD profile of the isothermally crystallized PLLA

samples shows three peaks at 2h = 16.7, 19.0 and

22.3, respectively, corresponding to the diffraction

peaks of (200)/(110), (203) and (015) planes of a
crystalline structure of PLLA. The diffraction inten-

sity of the peaks increases with the extension of

isothermal crystallization time, showing that

isothermal treatment at 120 C can effectively pro-

mote the crystallization of PLLA. By Gauss fitting of

the WAXD profiles, the crystallinity of all the samples

was calculated and is listed in Table 1. The results

demonstrate that the crystallinity of PLLA isother-

mally crystallized at 120 C increases with the

extension of isothermal crystallizing time, and can

even reach up to a level higher than 50%.

The different crystallinity of PLLA samples leads to

the differences of densities, which are listed in

Table 2. It can be seen that although the crystallinity

varies in a great range after crystallizing at 120 C for

different time, the change in density, showing a slight

increasing trends, is quite limited. However, when

the crystallinity increases, the ratio of the ordered

molecular chains in the system increases, leading to

the decrease in the volume of the sample. That is why

the density of PLLA increases a little with the

increasing of crystallinity.

The specific heat (Cp) was obtained by DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, America) at a heating rate of 10 C/
min. The Cp values of PLLA compression samples

with different crystallinity are calculated by Eq. (1):

Cp ¼ Cp0m0h= mHð Þ ð1Þ where Cp and Cp0, m and m0, h and H are the specific

heat, the weight and the heat flow of PLLA sample

and sapphire standard, respectively. The specific heat

of sapphire standard is given in the DSC software.

The calculated specific heat of PLLA samples is

shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the specific heat

increases linearly before 50 C. An abrupt increase in

the specific heat is observed in the glass transition

temperature range (50–70 C), resulting from the

change of free volume of PLLA [47], and then specific

heat remains constant for the samples with given

crystallinity after Tg. Thermal diffusivities of PLLA

samples with different crystallinity were measured

by laser flash method, which is a non-contact tran-

sient thermal measurement method widely used for

measuring the thermal diffusivity (a). With all these

parameters, the thermal conductivity of the samples

can be derived through Eq. (2):

k ¼ a q Cp ð2Þ where q is the bulk density and Cp is the specific heat

at a given pressure.

The thermal diffusivity and the thermal conduc-

tivity of PLLA samples with different crystallinity are

10546 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows that the thermal

diffusivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity reduces moderately due to the decrease in

the phonon mean free path when the temperature

rises, but drops abruptly within the glass transition

temperature range. Taking 120-40 as an example, the

thermal diffusivity decreases by 0.033 mm2/s from

- 70 to 60 C, but decreases by 0.017 mm2/s sharply

only from 60 to 80 C. The sudden drop can be

explained in terms of molecular mobility [48]. But it

should be noted that the abrupt drop trend around Tg

becomes gentler with increasing crystallinity of PLLA

samples. It can be understood from the fact that the

crystallized fractions refine the amorphous phase of

PLLA to a certain degree and hinder the molecular

motion in amorphous regions which will reduce the

phonon mean free path, especially at temperatures

near the glass transition.

Figure 3b shows the relationship between thermal

conductivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity and temperature. It can be found that the

environmental temperature affects the thermal con-

ductivity obviously. Notably, the glass transition

temperature exerts a great influence on the thermal

conductivity. In the glass state below Tg, thermal

conductivities of all the PLLA samples with different

crystallinity increase with temperature. In this tem-

perature range, two mechanisms with opposite

effects operate [48]. The thermal diffusivity decreases

with temperature increasing, while the increase in

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10547 specific heat attributes more to the thermal conduc-

tivity. The net effect is a smooth and moderate

increase in thermal conductivity with temperature

increasing. When the temperature is further

increased, the amorphous phase of PLLA sample gets

into rubbery state, and the molecular chains of the

amorphous phase begin to move, leading to a great

reduction in the phonon mean free path. So, the

thermal conductivity decreases remarkably. Such a

process produces the maximum of the thermal con-

ductivity near the glass transition temperature in the

range of the measured temperatures. Meanwhile, it

also can be seen that the thermal conductivity of

PLLA samples increases with the increase in crys-

tallinity of PLLA.

To further analyze the effect of the crystallinity on

the thermally conductive properties of PLLA, the

thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA samples at different temperatures

are presented as a function of crystallinity in Fig. 4. The specific heat changes linearly with the increase in

crystallinity of PLLA at different temperatures. The

slope of the fitting curve decreases from 0.118 to

- 0.46 with increasing temperature. It shows that the

specific heat of PLLA decreases with increasing

crystallinity when the temperature is higher than Tg,

due to that Cp for amorphous phase is larger than

crystal phase [49]. However, specific heat of PLLA

samples increases slowly with the increasing crys-

tallinity at temperatures below Tg. Thermal diffusiv-

ity of PLLA increases linearly with increasing

crystallinity, and the increasing rate keeps stable at

the temperatures below Tg, while the increasing rate

increases after Tg. When the amorphous phase is in

the rubber state, the motion of the molecular chains

reduces the phonon mean free path obviously, while

with the increasing crystallinity, the mean free path

increases distinctly. That is why the thermal diffu-

sivity increases obviously with increasing crys-

tallinity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of PLLA

samples as a result of the specific heat and thermal

diffusivity increases with increasing crystallinity.

at given temperatures.

10548 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 Though the specific heat decreases with increasing

crystallinity after Tg, the thermal diffusivity com-

pensates more for the thermal conductivity. The

increase in thermal conductivity of PLLA samples

with increasing crystallinity is in agreement with that

of other semi-crystallized polymers. However, it

should be noted that TC of PLLA is not significantly

increased with crystallinity. TC of PLLA with the

crystallinity of 56% (120-40) is 0.196 W/mK at 20 C,
only 0.025 W/mK larger than the thermal conduc-

tivity of amorphous PLLA (120-0).

Effect of molecular orientation
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

To obtain PLLA with different degrees of orientation

and to exclude the influence of crystallization,

amorphous PLLA rectangle samples (120-0 min)

were stretched to different strains uniaxially at 60 C
with the stretching rate of 20 mm/min. Different

positions were marked on the original bars. It is

found in Fig. S2(a) that the strain of every marked

length is consistent, which provides us proof for our

assumption that the orientation of different positions

on the tensile bar is similar. Taking 60-20-4 as an

example, 2D WAXD patterns of different positions on

the tensile bar are shown in Fig. S2(b) to verify the

degree of orientation. It shows that WAXD diffrac-

tions of the three different positions are almost the

same on the meridian and the isotropic scattering

halo develops into the two arcs along the meridian.

From the azimuth scan curve, it can be seen that the

curves of the ‘‘upper, middle, down’’ parts are basi-

cally also the same. These results indicate that

degrees of orientation of different positions along

drawing direction of the tensile bar are the same, and

the differences are negligible. This facilitates subse-

quent preparation of specimens for tests of in-plane

thermal diffusivity.

The middle part of PLLA bars stretched to different

strains is chosen to measure the degrees of orienta-

tion by 2D WAXD. The 2D WAXD patterns are

shown in Fig. 5. The un-stretched PLLA shows reg-

ular concentric rings, indicating that the initial PLLA

bar is amorphous and isotropic. With the increase in

tensile strain, the isotropic halo gradually concen-

trates to the meridian, which indicates that amor-

phous chains of PLLA samples get orientated

gradually along the drawing direction, and the

strength increases gradually. In this process, no

obvious crystal diffraction occurs. The meridian

intensity profiles extracted from the WAXD patterns

in Fig. 5b also show a very broad scattering peak of

amorphous phase without any traces of crystalline

phases. These results clearly demonstrated that the

stretched PLLA bars with different strains are all

amorphous and a series of PLLA with different

degrees of orientation have been achieved to further

reveal the influence of orientation on the thermal

conductivity of PLLA.

Both the in-plane and through-plane thermal dif-

fusivity of the stretched and un-stretched PLLA

samples were measured at 25 C. The thermal

intensity profiles (b) extracted from the WAXD patterns.

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10549 conductivities are calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the

specific heat and the density are constant, which are

the values of the aforementioned PLLA 120-0 min

(specific heat: 1.195 J/g K, density: 1.243 g/cm3). The

results are shown in Fig. 6. The relation between

thermal diffusivity in the in-plane direction and

tensile strain is opposite to the relation between

thermal diffusivity in the through-plane direction

and tensile strain. The thermal diffusivity in the in-

plane direction increases as the tensile strain increa-

ses, while the thermal diffusivity of PLLA samples in

the through-plane direction decreases with the

increase in tensile strain. This is owing to that the

thermal energy transports more efficiently parallel to

the tensile direction, i.e., along the polymer chain,

which consists of the strong covalent bonds, than

perpendicular to the polymer chain, where the ther-

mal energy is carried by the means of weak van der

Waals interaction of molecules [22]. That is to say, the

phonon mean free path along the tensile direction (in-

plane direction) is larger than that perpendicular to

the tensile direction (through-plane direction).

Therefore, with the increase in orientation, the ther-

mal diffusivity in the in-plane direction increases,

while the one in the through-plane direction decrea-

ses. As the specific heat and density are constant, the

variation of thermal conductivity (k) with the degree

of orientation is consistent with the variation of the

thermal diffusivity with the degree of orientation.

The thermal conductivity in the in-plane direction

(k//) increases linearly with the increase in tensile

strain, and thermal conductivity in the through-plane

direction (k\) decreases linearly with the increase in

tensile strain. When the tensile strain is 4, the TC in

the in-plane direction of PLLA is 0.348 W/mK, while

the TC in the through-plane direction decreases to

0.125 W/mK. The relative thermal conductivities (k/

k0)-strain data are also given in Fig. 7, showing that

the relative in-plane thermal conductivity (k///k0) is

low, only around 2 when tensile strain reaches to 4. Such a linear relationship between k (k// and k\) and

strain and low relative in-plane thermal conductivity

have also been observed previously for other amor-

phous polymers such as PS, PMMA, PC, etc. [30, 32].

conductivity of the oriented material and unoriented

material has been given as Eq. (3).

 

þ ð2=k?Þ ð3Þ TC in the directions parallel and perpendicular to

tensile direction would be principal conductivities

which would indeed bear the relationship of Eq. (3) to a neutral plane conductivity in uniaxially oriented

polymer. However, there is no fundamental reason

why this neutral plane conductivity is the same as the

conductivity of an unoriented specimen [32]. The

corresponding parameters in Eq. 3 of PLLA are listed

in Table 3. It is found that the thermal conductivities

of the oriented and unoriented PLLA conform with

the relationship of Eq. 3. Conclusion

In this work, different crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA were fabricated by isothermal

crystallization at 120 C for different minutes and

stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C at the

same speed to different strains, respectively. We have

demonstrated the effect of temperature, crystallinity

and degree of orientation on the thermal conductivity

of bulk PLLA samples. The thermal conductivity of

PLLA with different crystallinity was affected obvi-

ously by temperature. Before Tg, the thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature, mainly resulting from

the increasing specific heat. As the temperature is

further increased to be higher than Tg, the thermal

conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

decreases remarkably due to the obvious drop of

thermal diffusivity. It demonstrates that thermal

conductivity of PLLA increases with the increase in

crystallinity, but the increasing rate is quite limited.

With orientation, the conductivity was increased in

the direction of molecular orientation and decreased

in the perpendicular direction. The reciprocal of the

two thermal conductivities in different directions of

PLLA stretched to different strains fit a linear

relationship.

Available online 16 October 2012 Abstract

The effects of boron nitride (BN) content and particle size on the thermal properties of BN/high density polyethylene (HDPE)

composites were investigated. The thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of the composites were dependent on the BN content.

For composites with same amount of BN, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with an increase in the size of the

BN particles. Composites with a mixture of different-sized BN particles exhibited higher thermal conductivities than those of composites

with single-sized BN particles. The specific heat capacities of the composites were also affected by the BN content and particle size.

1. Introduction

For electronic packaging applications, materials with high
thermal conductivities are required to dissipate the heat
generated by the electronic component effectively. Polymers
are often used in these applications, in addition to being
employed as substrate materials, because of their low dielectric
properties and ease of processing. However, the thermal
conductivities of polymers are usually very low. Therefore,
there is a need to investigate ceramics-filled polymer compo-
sites that have high thermal conductivities [1–4].

Generally, the thermal conductivity of ceramic-filled
polymer composites increases with increasing ceramic
content and particle size. Particles with a high aspect ratio
such as flake- or fibre-shaped particles exhibit the bridging
phenomenon to a larger degree. This assists in the forma-
tion of a conductive path because the percolation threshold
for such particles is lower than that of spherical particles.
However, high-aspect-ratio particles have low packing
densities due to their increased porosity [3]. Usage of a
mixture of different-sized ceramic particles would increase
the thermal conductivity of composites [5–8], as the

packing densities of such composites would be higher than
those of composites with single-sized ceramic particles.
Flakes of BN were used as the filler in this study due to

their high conductivity, excellent temperature resistance,
light-weight nature, and moderate cost [1]. High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) was used as the polymer matrix since
HDPE is an engineering thermo-plastic used in several
industrial applications due to its low cost, desirable
mechanical properties, and ease of processing.
Therefore, the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE com-

posites was investigated on the basis of the volume fraction
(Vf) and size of the BN flakes. In addition, several
theoretical models were employed to predict the effective
thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted
values were compared with those obtained experimentally.

2. Experimental procedures

Powders (99.5%, Changsung Corp., Korea) comprising
BN flakes of different sizes were chosen as the fillers for the
polymer matrix composites. The sizes of the BN flakes in
the ceramic powders used in this study were 3 mm, 10 mm,
and 20 mm. HDPE (99.9%, Yuhwa Korea Petrochemical
Ind. Co., Korea) was used as a matrix for the composites.
The BN powders and HDPE were weighed as per the
roup S.r.l.

200 1C at a speed of 30 rpm for 20 min. The mixture was
hot-pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa for 30 min at
200 1C and cooled to room temperature.

The apparent densities of the composites were measured
by the Archimedes’ method. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (D/Max-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Japan) was used to
determine the content and the size of the particles in the
BN powders. The microstructures of the composites were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-
6500F, Jeol, Japan). The specific heat capacities (Cp) and
the thermal diffusivities were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model DSC 200F3, Netzsch,
Germany) and by a laser flash apparatus (LFA) (Model
LFA447, Netzsch, Germany), respectively. The thermal
conductivities of the composites were obtained using their
densities, specific heat capacities, and thermal diffusivities.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Physical properties of composites

The X-ray diffraction patterns for the BN/HDPE
composites with various volume fractions (Vf) and
BN-particle sizes are shown in Fig. 1. The semi-
crystalline phase of HDPE and the single crystalline phase
of BN (JCPDS no. 37-109) could be detected. With an
increase in the BN content, the intensity of the peak for
HDPE decreased. For a given BN content, the intensity of
the peak for HDPE increased with a decrease in the size of
the BN particles.

The peaks for the composites with a mixture of 3 mm-
and 20 mm-sized BN particles exhibited intensities that
were between the intensities of the peaks for the compo-
sites with BN particles with sizes of 3 mm and 20 mm,

respectively. The XRD patterns did not show peaks for
any reaction compounds of BN and HDPE, suggesting
that no chemical reaction took place between the BN
particles and HDPE.
Fig. 2 shows the apparent and theoretical densities of the

composites with various volume fractions (Vf). The appar-
ent and theoretical densities of the composites increased
with an increase in the BN content as the density of the BN
particles is higher than that of HDPE. For composites with
same amount of BN particles, the apparent density did not
change markedly with BN-particle size. With increasing
BN content, the difference between the apparent and
theoretical densities of the composites increased because
of the pores induced at the interface between polymer and
ceramics [3].
SEM micrographs of the composites with various

volume fractions and BN-particle sizes are shown in
Fig. 3. With increasing BN content (Fig. 3(a–c)), the
distance between the BN particles decreased. That is to
say that connectivity among the BN particles as well as the
interfacial area between BN and HDPE increased. The
composites with a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN
particles showed larger conductive networks than did the
composites with single-sized BN particles (Fig. 3(d) and
(e)). The composites with various volume fractions and
BN-particle sizes had the BN particles uniformly dispersed
within the HDPE matrix, with melted HDPE completely
covering the BN particles, resulting in the low porosity of
the composites.

3.2. Thermal properties of composite

The thermal diffusivities and specific heat capacities of
the composites with various volume fractions and BN-
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. With increasing BN
content, the thermal diffusivity of the composites
increased, while the specific heat capacity decreased. These

Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573 S571results are due to the fact that the thermal diffusivity of BN
is higher than that of HDPE, and its specific heat capacity is
lower than that of HDPE. The thermal diffusivity of the

composites increased with an increase in the size of the BN
particles due to the decrease in the interfacial thermal
barrier between BN and HDPE. However, the specific heat
capacity of the composites did not change markedly with
the size of the BN particles. A similar tendency has been
confirmed in BN/polybenzoxazine composites [9].
Fig. 4 shows the experimentally determined and theore-

tically calculated thermal conductivities of the composites
with various volume fractions and BN-particle sizes. The
experimentally determined thermal conductivity of the
composites increased with increasing BN content due to
the thermal conductivity of BN being higher than that of
HDPE. For a given ceramic content, the thermal con-
ductivity of the composites increased with increasing BN-
particle size because the heat conducting paths were
thicker and the junctions had lower thermal resistance in
the composites with the larger particles of BN than in the
composites with smaller BN particles.
For electronic packaging applications, the ability to

predict the thermal conductivity of the composites effec-
tively should be considered when designing ceramic/poly-
mer composites with high thermal conductivity. Several
theoretical models were employed to predict the thermal
conductivity of the composites with various volume frac-
tions and BN-particle sizes. The Bruggeman and Russell

Y.K. Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573S572models [6] were not used to fit the experimental data due to
the fact that the fillers used in this study were not spherical
or cubic in shape. However, the Nielsen–Lewis model
[6,10] was in good agreement with the experimental values
well up to Vf of 0.4, above which the model failed because
of the presence of pores, as shown in Fig. 4. This result is due to the fact that, unlike the other
models, the Nielsen–Lewis model includes a fitting para-
meter A (morphology factor) to describe the shape of the
filler. The Nielsen–Lewis model is based on the following
equation:

where leff, lp, and lc are the thermal conductivities of the
composites, polymer, and ceramic, respectively; Vf is
the volume faction of the ceramic; constant A is related
to the morphology of the composites (irregular-shaped
particles have a larger value of A than do spherical
particles (A¼1.5)); fm is maximum packing fraction. For
composites with same amount of BN particles, the values
of A and fm increased with increasing BN-particle sizes
(Fig. 4).

Fig. 5 shows the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE
composites with the volume fraction of BN equal to Vf of
0.3 and a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles.
For the composites with the Vf of 0.3 and a mixture of
3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles, the thermal conduc-
tivity increased when Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles was
0.09. It then decreased with a further increase in the
volume fraction of the 3 mm-sized BN particles. These
results can be explained by the fact that the 3 mm-sized BN
particles fill the space between the 20 mm-sized BN parti-
cles until Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles reaches 0.09(Fig. 3(f)). This leads to an increase in the number of
conductive paths.

4. Conclusions

With increasing BN content, the thermal conductivities
and the thermal diffusivities of BN/HDPE composites
increased, while the specific heat capacities decreased.
For a given BN content, the thermal conductivity and
the thermal diffusivity of the composites increased with an
increase in the sizes of the BN particles. However, the
specific heat capacity of the composites did not change
markedly with the BN-particle size. The thermal conduc-
tivity of composites containing a mixture of different-sized
BN particles was higher than that of composites contain-
ing only single-sized BN particles (3 mm or 20 mm). The
experimentally determined values of thermal conductivity
were in good agreement with those obtained using the
Nielsen–Lewis model.

Influence of the Molecular Architecture of Low-Density
Polyethylene on the Texture and Mechanical Properties
of Blown Films

Received 7 February 2002; revised 30 April 2002; accepted 31 October 2002 ABSTRACT: Three types of low-density polyethylene materials were investigated with
respect to the influence of the molecular architecture on the mechanical and use
properties of blown films. The materials were a branched polyethylene synthesized by
free-radical polymerization under high-pressure (HP-LDPE), a linear ethylene–hexene
copolymer (ZN-LLDPE) produced by low-pressure Ziegler–Natta catalysis, and an
ethylene–hexene copolymer (M-LLDPE) from metallocene catalysis. The extrusion and
blowing conditions were identical for the three materials, with a take-up ratio of 12 and
a blow-up ratio of 2.5. The blown films displayed a decreasing puncture resistance in
the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and HP-LDPE. In parallel, the tear resistance of the
films became increasingly unbalanced in the same order of the polymers. The morpho-
logical study showed an increased anisotropy of the films in the same polymer order, the
crystalline lamellae being increasingly oriented normal to the take-up direction. This
texturing caused a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the films, notably
increasing the capacity for crack propagation. The phenomenon was ascribed to the
kinetics of chain relaxation in the melt that governed the ability of the chains to recover
an isotropic state from the flow-induced stretching before crystallization. The puncture
resistance was examined in terms of both texture and strain-hardening capabilities.

INTRODUCTION

Since the early 1970s, ethylene/-olefin copoly-
mers synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysis have
been largely developed in the domain of blown
films for packaging applications, in concurrence
with low-density polyethylenes (PEs) produced by
high-pressure free-radical polymerization. In re-

cent years, copolymers issued from metallocene
technology have taken an increasing place in the
field of film blowing because of excellent optical
properties combined with remarkable mechanical
performances.1 For the processing difficulties of
metallocene copolymers due to narrow molar
weight distributions (MWDs), technical solutions
have been found by either the incorporation of
very low amounts of long side chains or the pro-
duction of bimodal MWDs.2,3 There is, however,
much work left to do to understand the property
upgrade of such novel materials, notably for film
applications.

The influence of molecular orientation on the
use properties of PE blown films has stimulated
profuse studies on the processing–structure and
processing–property relationships.4–31 Neverthe-
less, little has been accomplished in terms of un-
derstanding the influence of the molecular archi-
tecture on the structure and mechanical proper-
ties of films, via processing conditions. This study
focused on three types of low-density PE issued
from three different types of polymerization tech-
niques. The differences in the use properties of
the blown films were analyzed through the crys-
talline texture under similar processing condi-
tions for the various polymers.

EXPERIMENTAL

Three low-density PE materials from various
sources were studied. The molecular and physical
characteristics of the materials are shown in Ta-
ble 1. M-LLDPE and ZN-LLDPE were linear eth-
ylene–hexene copolymers synthesized by metal-
locene and Ziegler–Natta catalysts, respectively.
The former one, with a narrower MWD, was sus-
pected to contain a few long side chains on the
basis of elongational viscosity. HP-LDPE was is-
sued from the high-pressure free-radical polymer-
ization of ethylene in an autoclave. It contained
long-chain branches (LCBs) and short-chain
branches (SCBs) mainly composed of butyl side
groups with minor amounts of ethyl side
groups.32 Tubular blown films, about 50 m thick, were
processed with an annular die extruder with a
15-cm diameter and a 1.5-mm gap. For the sake of
comparison of the blown-film properties, the pro-
cessing conditions were kept as close as possible
for the three materials: flow rate  40 kg/h, melt
temperature at the die  190 °C, frost-line height
 50 cm, take-up speed  12 m/min, take-up ratio
(TUR) 12 in the so-called machine direction
(MD), and blow-up ratio (BUR)  2.5 in the trans-

verse direction (TD). These conditions corre-
sponded to the optimum blowing capabilities of
HP-LDPE. The direction perpendicular to the film
surface was defined as the normal direction (ND).

For the evaluation of the intrinsic properties of
the materials, 1-mm-thick isotropic sheets were
also prepared. Pellets were compression-molded
for 5 min at 180 °C and subsequently crystallized
by being cooled to room temperature (RT) at
about 20 °C/min.

The relaxation time, , of the materials in the
melt was determined from viscoelastic measure-
ments at 190 °C with a Rheometric RSA II appa-
ratus in the cone–plane configuration. The assess-
ment of  was made from the Cole–Cole diagram
of the loss shear modulus versus the storage
shear modulus.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) mea-
surements were performed on a PerkinElmer
DSC-7 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The calibration of the temperature scale was
achieved from the melting scans of high-purity
indium and zinc samples at the same heating
rate. The melting point (Tf) of the materials was
determined at the peak of the melting endotherm
of the heating scan following standard cooling
from the melt at 10 °C/min.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used
to investigate the crystalline lamellar morphology
and texture of the films. The X-ray beam was
provided by a Rigaku Cu rotating anode having a
0.1 mm focus and operated at 30 kV and 40 mA.
An assembly of two Ni-coated curved mirrors at a
right angle was used for a punctual collimation of
the incident beam. The scattered intensity was
detected with a position-sensitive linear counter
selecting Cu K X-ray photons. It was located at
80 cm of the sample, with a vacuum section be-
tween the detector and sample. For optimum X-
ray absorption, approximately 2-mm-thick sam-
ples were made by several pieces of films or com-
pression-molded sheets being piled up. For blown
films, the through-view scattering curves were

recorded parallel to both MD and TD. Edge-view
scattering curves were also recorded parallel to
MD and ND. For a comparison of the scattering
intensity profiles versus the scattering vector of
the various materials, all the intensity data in
arbitrary units were corrected for the background
scattering, absorption, and Lorentz factor.33 The
transmission coefficient for every sample was de-
termined from the ratio of the peak intensities of
the incident beam with and without the sample.
The intercrystalline long period, L, was directly
determined from the correlation peak of the in-
tensity profile. The average crystal thickness, Lc,
was assessed from the equation Lc  Lc, which
assumes much greater length and width of the
crystalline lamellae than their thickness. The
crystal volume fraction, c, was computed from
the density, , of the material with the relation c

 (  a)/(c  a), where c  1.000 g/cm3 and a

 0.855 g/cm are the densities of perfectly crys-
talline orthorhombic PE and amorphous PE, re-
spectively.34 Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experi-
ments were performed in the transmission mode
with monochromatic Cu K radiation. Through-
view patterns on films were recorded on a two-
dimensional CCD camera.

The tear and puncture resistance of the blown
films were determined at RT according to the
standard Elmendorf test (ASTM D 1922) and dart
impact test (ASTM D 1709), respectively. Conven-
tional tensile stress–strain measurements were
carried out at RT on an Instron testing machine
at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min, with dumb-
bell samples 100 mm in gauge length. Both iso-
tropic sheets and films were tested. For films,
tensile experiments were carried out along MD
and TD. The reported curves are representative of
three different measurements.

Shrinkage measurements of the blown films
above Tf were carried out with 5 cm  5 cm
specimens suspended by small clamps into an
oven at 130 °C for 5 min. Shrinkage data along
MD and TD were assessed from the ratio of the
dimension change to the initial dimension of the
film piece. Experiments at various temperatures
between 125 and 135 °C showed some tempera-
ture dependence of the M-LLDPE shrinkage,
whereas ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE proved to be
almost insensitive. However, the ranking of the
materials in terms of shrinkage capacity did not
depend on temperature.

TEAR AND PUNCTURE RESISTANCE OF
THE FILMS

An examination of the dart impact data of films in
Table 2 shows that HP-LDPE has the lowest
puncture resistance of the three materials. More-
over, the perforation of HP-LDPE films appears
as an elongated crack parallel to TD. In contrast,
ZN-LLDPE exhibits an elongated perforation par-
allel to MD. M-LLDPE displays the best film
puncture resistance, and the perforation is fairly
circular. These observations are relevant to the
structural anisotropy of both HP-LDPE and ZN-
LLDPE, whereas M-LLDPE looks rather iso-
tropic.

Under tear testing, HP-LDPE displays the low-
est capabilities of the three materials. It is nota-
bly unbalanced, with a higher tear resistance in
MD. The better tear performances of M-LLDPE
are fairly well equilibrated along MD and TD.
M-LLDPE is challenged by ZN-LLDPE with re-
spect to the level of tear resistance, even though
the latter displays nonequilibrated properties,
the higher tear resistance being in TD.

In summary, the puncture and tear properties
of M-LLDPE are fairly high and isotropic despite
the largely unbalanced TUR and BUR of the
films. In contrast, HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE re-
veal strong anisotropy along TD and MD that
suggests chain orientation and/or crystalline tex-
turing of the films. The anisotropy effect is, how-
ever, opposite in the two materials, despite iden-
tical blowing conditions: ZN-LLDPE is more tear-
resistant in TD than in MD, whereas HP-LDPE
displays greater tear resistance in MD. Similar
observations of opposite behavior between linear
PE films11,15,23,24,30 and branched PE films20,28 can be found in the literature for usual blowing
conditions notably involving TUR  BUR. This
surprising finding suggests that the intuitive pic-
ture of an improved tear resistance normal to the

in most cases, does work for ZN-LLDPE but does
not work for HP-LDPE. Otherwise, it was pro-
posed by Kim and coworkers23,24 and Andre et
al.29 that crystalline lamellar orientation might
be more important than the molecular orientation
with respect to tear resistance because lamellae
are likely to act as obstacles to crack propagation.
This is the reason for the following structural
study.

STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE

Compression-Molded Sheets

For the three kinds of PE studied, the SAXS data
of Table 3 reveal very similar if not equal crystal
thicknesses for isotropic sheets and films. This is
relevant to the relatively low sensitivity of low-
density PE materials to the cooling rate, that is,
about 20°/s for blown films and 20°/min for com-
pression-molded sheets.

Considering the densities of the materials under
investigation and using the data from Kuhn and
Krömer,32 we can assume a butyl SCB rate of about
17/1000 C (where C is a carbon atom of the polymer
backbone) for HP-LDPE, whereas a rough figure of
18/1000 C can be assumed for the butyl SCB con-
centration of both ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE ac-
cording to various literature data.23,35,36 Under
such considerations, it turns out that the average
distance between short branches along the main
chain is about 7 nm. The quite good consistency of
this figure with the crystal thickness of the materi-
als reported in Table 3 supports the largely ac-
cepted scheme of an exclusion from the crystalline
phase of the SCB having two carbon atoms or more.
As a matter of fact, if the SCB bulkiness prevents
the counit inclusion in the crystal lattice due to
crystal growth, one should expect Lc to be governed

by the average length of the crystallizable methyl-
ene sequences.37 M-LLDPE and HP-LDPE have somewhat
lower Lc values (Table 3) than ZN-LLDPE, with
a concomitant lower Tf. This is relevant to the
more uniform distribution of the counits or
SCBs of the former two materials. Heteroge-
neous ZN copolymers are indeed well known to
grow thicker crystals with higher Tf values than
homogeneous copolymers or branched PEs of
similar crystallinity38 – 40 because of almost
counit-free chains. This is an advantage for
some applications such as hot tack but is prej-
udicial for optical properties, for instance.38 This structural difference should nonetheless
have very little impact on tear and puncture
properties, notably on anisotropy.

Blown Films

Figure 1 shows the through-view SAXS profiles
from the films of the three materials recorded
parallel to MD and TD. The nearly identical in-
tensity profiles of Figure 1(c) indicate a fairly
isotropic structure for M-LLDPE in the plane of
the film, which contrasts with the strong anisot-
ropy of the HP-LDPE film revealed in Figure 1(a).
Not only is the SAXS correlation peak much
higher along MD than along TD for HP-LDPE,
but the peak intensities are respectively greater
and smaller than those of the M-LLDPE SAXS
peak. This anisotropy of HP-LDPE is relevant to
the well-known flow-induced row texture of blown
films and spun fibers41 with the crystalline lamel-
lae essentially normal to MD. The ZN-LLDPE
film displays an intermediate state of orientation
[Fig. 1(b)] between HP-LDPE and M-LLDPE
films [Fig. 1(a,c)], the crystalline lamellae being
still preferentially normal to MD.

SAXS measurements from the edges of the
films corroborate the row texture of the HP-LDPE

film, as judged from Figure 2. As a matter of fact,
the edge-view profile recorded along MD shows a
much stronger intensity maximum than the one

along ND. This is clear evidence that most of the
crystalline lamellae lie normal to MD. It is quite
surprising that M-LLDPE also displays some an-
isotropy from the edge view of the film [Fig. 2(b)],
which suggests that the elongated crystalline la-
mellae, otherwise lamellar ribbons, have a pre-
dominant orientation along ND. Considering the
through-view isotropy of M-LLDPE [Fig. 1(c)], we
may ascribe this finding to a preferred orientation
of the growth direction of the lamellar ribbons,
namely, the crystallographic b axis,42 along the
temperature gradient43,44 during the crystalliza-
tion step, that is, the film thickness in this in-
stance. This effect should also exist for HP-LDPE
but is certainly hidden by the flow-induced row
texture. The M-LLDPE film may, therefore, be
called orthotropic rather than isotropic.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 331 The WAXS patterns of Figure 3 show a rein-
forcement of the inner (110) and outer (200) re-
flections in the MD and TD positions, respec-
tively, for HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films. This is
relevant to the so-called low-stress row structure
of Keller and Machin,41 which corresponds to a
preferred orientation of the twisted crystalline
lamellae with the crystallographic b axis, that is,
the growth axis, roughly parallel to TD, and the a
and c axes being randomly distributed about TD
because of the lamellar twisting. The diagonal
reinforcement of the (110) reflection for the HP-
LDPE film [Fig. 3(a)] reveals a sharper orienta-
tion of the b axis parallel to TD than for ZN-
LLDPE. The M-LLDPE film displays no preferred
orientation of the crystalline phase in the film,
indicating isotropy or orthotropy. These WAXS
data corroborate the conclusions from SAXS.

With respect to the compression-molded
sheets, the unreported WAXS patterns confirm
the completely isotropic structure for the three
materials.

UNIAXIAL TENSILE DRAWING

Compression-Molded Sheets

In conjunction with structural investigations,
several authors have used uniaxial tensile draw-
ing of blown films to understand the tear and
puncture behavior.10,20,24,30,31 Because the dart
test is equivalent to a multiaxial tensile test, it is
obvious that uniaxial testing at various orienta-
tions with respect to MD may be valuable for
understanding the puncture resistance of films.
In contrast, tensile drawing does not seem to have
significant relevance to tear resistance, at first
sight. Nevertheless, it clearly appears from the
literature data24,30 that the more unbalanced the
tear resistance is in MD and TD of blown films,
the greater the departure is of both the strain
hardening and the elongation at break of the films
upon tensile drawing along MD and TD.

The engineering stress–strain curves of the iso-
tropic compression-molded polymers are reported
in Figure 4. The three materials have about the
same yield stress at 10  1 MPa. However, HP-
LDPE displays a lower elongation at rupture and
a lower strain hardening than ZN-LLDPE. This
well-known phenomenon can be ascribed to the
bulkiness of the branched molecules with LCBs,
which limit chain overlapping in the melt. A re-

films: (a) HP-LDPE, (b) ZN-LLDPE, and (c) M-LLDPE

sult of this phenomenon is to reduce the entan-
glement density and the intercrystalline tie chain
frequency in the crystallized material.38 This
point is more specifically addressed in the Discus-
sion section.

M-LLDPE displays a lower elongation at break
than ZN-LLDPE but exhibits a surprisingly
higher strain hardening. A similar observation in
a previous study40 has been ascribed to a higher
concentration of entanglements and tie chains in
M-LLDPE because of the homogeneous distribu-
tions of the counits, which not only reduces crys-
tal thickness in comparison with ZN-LLDPE (see
the previous section) but also reduces the pro-
cesses of regular folding and reeling-induced dis-
entanglement of the chains during crystalliza-
tion. Therefore, in contrast to HP-LDPE, which is
less resistant to tensile drawing than ZN-LLDPE
because of lower overlapping of the chains, M-
LLDPE looks significantly more resistant than
ZN-LLDPE because of better chain intertwining.

Blown Films

Figure 5 shows the tensile stress–strain curves
along MD and TD for the three types of films.
M-LLDPE displays quite similar behavior when
tested along MD and TD [Fig. 5(c)]. Besides, the
stress–strain curves resemble that of the isotropic
compression-molded sheet (Fig. 4), notably with
respect to extension at break and strain harden-
ing. This finding means that M-LLDPE is almost
isotropic and accounts for the well-equilibrated

TD and MD tear resistance. In contrast, HP-
LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films exhibit unbalanced
tensile properties along MD and TD [Fig. 5(a,b)],

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 333 notably a lower drawability along MD. Besides,
drawability in both directions is lower than that
of the compression-molded sheets, this phenome-
non being much more pronounced for HP-LDPE.
This means that both ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display a higher degree of chain extension in MD.
In parallel to its much reduced drawability in
MD, HP-LDPE displays a surprising jump of the
yield stress to about 15 MPa in MD, in contrast to
10 MPa in TD and for the isotropic sheet. This point
is specifically addressed in the Discussion section.

The nearly isotropic properties of the M-
LLDPE film suggest that the chains have an al-
most undisturbed coil conformation despite the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. In contrast,
the unbalanced properties of ZN-LLDPE and HP-
LDPE films, together with the significant loss of
drawability with respect to their isotropic com-
pression-molded counterparts, are relevant to a
significant chain extension in the films. This is
evidence that the flow-induced extension of the
chains during the blowing process has been partly
frozen-in during the solidification step, for both
HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE. This suggests that
these two materials have less capacity for chain
relaxation in the melt than M-LLDPE, HP-LDPE
being the most quenching-sensitive.

The strain hardening of M-LLDPE, both in
films and sheets, is somewhat higher than that of
the two other materials. Such a property notably
reduces the capacity for plastic instabilities dur-
ing deformation and, therefore, contributes to the
improvement of the puncture resistance of the
M-LLDPE film. As a corollary to its higher strain
hardening, the M-LLDPE film exhibits lower
standard deviations of the tear and puncture re-
sistance data (Table 2) that are relevant to a
weaker sensitivity to structural film defects such
as thickness fluctuations and inclusions.

DISCUSSION

Table 4 reports a summary of the film properties.
Both structural and mechanical anisotropy in-
crease in the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and
HP-LDPE. In comparison with the compression-
molded sheets, the tensile drawing of the films
clearly reveals that, despite the similar blowing
conditions, the three materials have different lev-
els of chain extension (otherwise chain unfolding)
depending on the chain architecture. The shrink-
age data of Table 4, which reflect the degree of
chain extension frozen in the films, thoroughly
support this conclusion. The material rankings
for the degree of chain extension of the films are
the same as the previous ones for the increasing
anisotropy. The different levels of chain extension
of the three materials, superimposed on the crys-
talline texturing, can be analyzed with regard to
the rheological properties of the materials, in re-
lation to the processing conditions.

Chain Relaxation during Blowing

The mean relaxation time data of Table 1 show
that the three materials have quite different ca-
pabilities of relaxation in the melt of the flow-
induced chain extension accompanying TUR  12and BUR  2.5. Considering the frost-line height
of about 50 cm and the take-up speed of 12 m/min
used in the blowing process, one may estimate
that the molten material experiences an exten-
sional flow for about 2.5 s before solidification.
The actual duration of the extensional flow is
certainly shorter than this figure because the
chain-extension pathway along TD and MD is not
uniform over the whole length between the die
and the frost line. Therefore, it is clear that the
relaxation time of HP-LDPE may hardly allow a

recovery of the flow-induced chain extension dur-
ing the time that elapses between extrusion and
crystallization. In contrast, ZN-LLDPE and M-
LLDPE are clearly capable of relaxing the flow-
induced chain extension, at least in part, before
crystallization.

Ghaneh-Fard et al.45 pointed out the role of
chain relaxation on the orientational behavior of
blown films in the melt before crystallization. Yu
and Wilkes22 emphasized the drastic effect of long
chains having a long relaxation time on film ori-
entation. Lu et al.30,31 demonstrated that the
shape of the incipient bubble, which is governed
by the cooling conditions, strongly influences the
film texture and properties because of the modi-
fications of the relaxation capabilities of the mol-
ten material along MD and TD. Prasad et al.46 also reported recently that LCBs in linear HDPE
induce a strong texturing of blown films because
of a drastic increase of the longest relaxation time
in the melt. In contrast, Plumbey et al.20 reported
a nearly isotropic structure for metallocene copol-
ymer films, despite unbalanced TUR and BUR
values. Recently, Legros et al.26 reported that
metallocene copolymers afford significantly less
oriented films than corresponding Ziegler–Natta
copolymers. These observations, which corrobo-
rate our own findings on the M-LLDPE film, can
unambiguously be ascribed to the rather short
relaxation time of metallocene copolymers, which
is due to the narrow MWD.

With respect to the shrinkage behavior, the
data reported in the last column of Table 4 show
that the three kinds of films systematically shrink
more along MD than along TD. However, these
data also display quite different shrinkage capa-
bilities of the films in the order HP-LDPE  ZN-
LLDPE  M-LLDPE. The very low shrinkage of
the M-LLDPE film is notably indicative of a very
faint chain extension. This finding thoroughly
agrees with the MD and TD tensile drawing be-
havior of the M-LLDPE film, which closely resem-
bles that of the compression-molded sheet. There-
fore, the so-called orthotropy of the M-LLDPE
film, which has been concluded from the stand-
point of texture, turns out to be very close to
isotropy from a mechanical standpoint.

ZN-LLDPE is slightly unbalanced with respect
to the stress–strain curves in TD and MD [Fig.
5(b)], and the curves are not so far from the one of
the isotropic sheet (Fig. 4). In contrast, HP-LDPE
is highly unbalanced, and the stress–strain
curves reveal higher drawability along TD. Be-

sides, HP-LDPE displays significantly lower
strain hardening and lower stress at break than
ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE. The strong mechani-
cal anisotropy and poor performances at rupture
provide an explanation for the relatively poor dart
impact resistance of the HP-LDPE film.

The contrasting behaviors of HP-LDPE and
ZN-LLDPE with respect to tearing, that is, the
higher tear resistance being along MD and TD,
respectively, suggest a competition between crys-
tal orientation and chain extension in the process
of crack propagation, which is discussed later.

The quite different degrees of texturing of the
three kinds of materials, which greatly influence
their tensile drawing behavior and use properties,
can be explained by the rheology of the materials:
the much shorter relaxation time of M-LLDPE in
the melt allows an almost complete relaxation of
the flow-extended chains toward the stable ran-
dom coil conformation, during the time elapsing
between the die and the frost line. ZN-LLDPE
and HP-LDPE are only partly able to relax the
chain extension before crystallization, the latter
having greater hindrance for chain relaxation.

Chain Intertwining

The entanglement of chains has a tremendous
effect on both rheological and solid state prop-
erties. It strongly contributes to the strain-
hardening effect in the elongational viscosity,
which is a basic factor of bubble stability during
tubular film blowing.47 It is also a determining
factor for the mechanical properties of blown
films via drawability and strain hardening.
However, it is noteworthy that branched and
linear PEs display a puzzling opposite behavior
with respect to this latter property: namely, the
strain hardening of melt elongational viscosity
is high for branched PEs and low for linear
PEs,47 whereas just the opposite trend is ob-
served for the solid materials.38 This phenomenon emphasizes the drastic in-
fluence of molecular dynamics on chain extension
in the melt, which contrasts with the predomi-
nance of structural factors such as the entangle-
ment density on chain extension in the solid state.
Indeed, in the case of elongational flow experi-
ments,47 the strain hardening of branched PEs,
which is relevant to chain extension, can be re-
duced to about nothing if the timescale of the
experiments is comparable or greater than the
relaxation time. This is a clear indication of the

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 335 transient character of the chain network in the
melt, which may disentangle under extensional
flow at a low strain rate. For linear PEs, no strain
hardening of the elongational viscosity suggests a
high capacity for chain disentanglement during
extensional flow. In the solid state, chain exten-
sion is governed by the entanglement density,
which determines the strain hardening.48 The
lower strain hardening of branched PEs may be
ascribed to a low entanglement density.

The ability of polymer chains for intertwining
in the melt is mainly connected to the chain flex-
ibility, which is explained by the so-called C

parameter. Besides this parameter, the overlap-
ping capability of the chain coils of a given poly-
mer species, such as PE in this instance, is highly
sensitive to the molecular architecture of the
chains. If we neglect thermal expansion effects,
the degree of chain overlap in the melt can be
defined as the ratio

X  /app (1) of the actual density of molten PE,   0.85 g/cm3,to the apparent density of the chain coils, app.
Indeed, if we consider an isolated chain of molar
weight M, the X parameter provides an estima-
tion of the number of parent chains of the same
molar weight that must intertwine within the
volume embraced by the isolated chain in a ran-
dom coil conformation to achieve the actual den-
sity of the molten polymer. The apparent density
of the isolated chain can be estimated from the
ratio of the molar weight to the volume of the
sphere of radius equal to the radius of gyration of
the random coil, Rg, because this sphere enfolds
more than 90% of the segments of the chain coil.49 For linear PE and ethylene copolymers, one may
consider the following relationship established
from literature data:50 Rg  1.26M1⁄2 (2) where Rg is given in nanometers and M is given in
kilodaltons. Now, if we consider a linear low-den-
sity polyethylene (LLDPE) chain with M  100kDa, that is, about the weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) for the polymers investigated in this
work, it turns out that Rg is approximately 12.6nm, and the apparent density is app  0.02 g/cm3.Borrowing from Kuhn and Kromer’s32 study of
the molecular architecture of HP-LDPE, we have

sketched Figure 6 a chain of molar weight M
 100 kDa of the single-autoclave HP-LDPE in a
branch-extended conformation. The HP-LDPE
molecule notably exhibits 10 LCBs with an aver-
age molar weight between LCBs close to 6 kDa.
One may estimate to about 42 kDa the molar
weight of its main chain, which is shown as a bold
line in Figure 6. Assuming, in the first approxi-
mation, that LCBs do not significantly change the
chain conformation in the melt, one may estimate
the radius of gyration of the HP-LDPE chain coil,
Rg  8.0 nm, from the length of its main chain
with eq 2. The apparent density of the HP-LDPE
chain coil is, therefore, app  0.08 g/cm3. Despite numerous assumptions, the aforemen-
tioned apparent density data reveal that the
chains are deeply interpenetrated in the molten
materials: for a chain of molar weight M  100kDa, the degree of chain overlap is X  50 for
LLDPE and X  12 for HP-LDPE. Besides, these
data show that chain overlap is much greater for
LLDPE than for HP-LDPE.

This finding suggests that interchain entangle-
ments, which provide the strength of the molecu-
lar network in the melt and in the solid state, are
significantly more numerous in linear chains
than in branched chains. Indeed, reduced over-
lapping reduces the probability of neighboring
chains intertwining with each other. This has
already been claimed to be an explanation for the

Figure 6. Schematic drawing for the molecular archi-
tecture of an HP-LDPE branched chain with a molar
weight of 100 kDa.

336 GUICHON ET AL.

higher strain hardening of linear PEs in the solid
state.38 Of course, LCBs can make entanglements
among themselves, within the sphere of gyration
of the coil, but these intramolecular entangle-
ments only contribute to the coil stiffness instead
of the network strength. However, as previously
pointed out, the strain hardening in the melt is
lower for linear PEs than for branched PEs. This
phenomenon, apparently contradicting the higher
entanglement density of linear PEs, can be ex-
plained by dynamic effects during the extensional
flow in the melt,47,51 namely, a lower resistance to
either disentanglement or strain-induced orienta-
tion of linear chains in comparison with branched
chains. The longer relaxation time in the melt of
branched PEs (see Table 1) supports this proposal
of reduced chain dynamics due to LCBs.

Chain Unfolding versus Chain and/or Lamellar
Orientation

Several authors have recently suggested that the
orientation of lamellar stacks in blown films is
responsible for unbalanced properties,24,29–31 in
contrast with most authors, who incriminate mo-
lecular orientation. Lu et al.30,31 notably showed
that processing conditions that promote randomly
oriented lamellar stacks reduce mechanical an-
isotropy and improve dart impact resistance. Our
data on M-LLDPE thoroughly support this find-
ing. However, because ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display the same type of texture, with the lamel-
lae preferentially oriented normal to MD, the re-
verse trend of the two types of films with respect
to MD and TD tear resistance reveal that the real
situation is somewhat more complex than that
previously described. We suggest that, beyond la-
mellar and chain orientations, chain unfolding is
a factor of prime importance.

It is quite obvious that the unfolding of the
chains during the blowing process increases the
density of chain segments lying in the plane of the
film. If one intuitively considers that tear resis-
tance is governed by the frequency of such chain
segments that oppose themselves to the propaga-
tion of the crack, one should expect an improve-
ment of tear resistance with increasing chain ex-
tension. The drawability and shrinkage data from
Table 1 clearly show that the ZN-LLDPE film has
preferred chain extension along MD, and this
means that more chain segments will bar the way
to the crack propagation along TD in comparison

with MD. This is why ZN-LLDPE has greater tear
resistance in TD than in MD.

Regarding the HP-LDPE film, both drawability
and shrinkage show that there is a high degree of
chain extension along MD and moderate chain
extension along TD, the latter being significantly
higher than that for ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE.
An explanation for this is that the branches of the
star-shaped macromolecules are unfolded in the
two main directions during the blowing process,
and only a part of this unfolding can be relaxed
before crystallization because of the rather high
relaxation time. The chain extension that is fro-
zen in the film is greater along MD because of the
higher value of TUR with respect to BUR. In
addition, because the chains are not ideally
spherical but consist of a main chain with lateral
LCBs, as sketched in Figure 6, this main chain is
likely to preferentially unfold along MD during
the blowing process because TUR  BUR and also
because of a suspected much longer relaxation
time of the main chain in comparison with that of
the LCBs. Consequently, the LCBs should act as
molecular arms, slightly extended in TD, all along
the main chain. If this is the case, a propagating
crack would cross more chain segments in MD
than in TD. This provides an explanation for the
greater tear resistance of HP-LDPE in MD than
in TD, that is, a reverse behavior of that of ZN-
LLDPE. Nevertheless, the overall higher level of
tear resistance of the latter can be explained by
the higher degree of chain overlapping of ZN-
LLDPE, which involves a higher degree of chain
entanglement and, therefore, a higher mechani-
cal strength of the macromolecular network.

The fact that the M-LLDPE film is challenged
by the ZN-LLDPE film with respect to the level of
the tear resistance in both MD and TD, despite its
well-equilibrated tear behavior and better punc-
ture resistance, deserves special attention. The
explanation is straightforward in consideration of
our previous argument on the density of chain
segments that can act as obstacles to the propa-
gation of the crack during the tear test. Indeed,
the nearly isotropic M-LLDPE film necessarily
contains fewer chain segments oriented parallel
to the film plane than the ZN-LLDPE film to
make opposition to either MD or TD tear. It is,
therefore, suggested that isotropy is beneficial for
puncture resistance because of the high drawabil-
ity afforded by the chain in a random coil confor-
mation, but this is not favorable for optimum tear
resistance, despite good balance.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 337 Finally, a last comment should be made re-
garding the shape of the stress–strain curve along
MD of the HP-LDPE film, the yield stress being
50% higher than that along TD, as well as that of
the isotropic material. This phenomenon has been
reported previously for branched PEs38 but never
for linear PEs. This cannot be explained solely by
the high degree of chain extension along MD. We
suspect that the strong orientation of the crystal-
line lamellae with their normal along MD, as
judged from SAXS [Fig. 1(a)], prevents the plastic
shear processes through both the sample width
and thickness of the film because the resolved
shear stress (RSS) on the (hk0) slip planes is nil.
Plasticity may only take place after some tilt of
the lamellae to orient the slip planes toward the
maximum RSS. Rotation about the b axis is by far
the most easy tilt process because of the rather
large form factor of the lamellae. However, the
high degree of chain extension along MD, already
discussed, is likely to hinder the lamellar tilting
as the applied tensile stress increases. The criti-
cal RSS in the crystalline lamellae will then be
reached after the applied tensile stress has
jumped much above the value required for yield-
ing for the corresponding isotropic sample.

Isotropy versus Orthotropy

ZN-LLDPE exhibits better tear resistance than
M-LLDPE, despite its anisotropy. In contrast, iso-
tropic M-LLDPE has a better puncture resistance
because of high drawability with high energy ab-
sorption. Therefore, if the chain extension that
takes place during blowing involves an increase
in the chain segment density within the film
plane that is beneficial for tear resistance, it is
quite clear that isotropy is beneficial for puncture
resistance. One may, nevertheless, wonder if or-
thotropy, involving equilibrated chain extension
along MD and TD, would not be the best way for
optimum puncture and tear resistance, with a fair
balance of the latter along MD and TD.

Metallocene PEs have short relaxation times in
the melt that make them able to recover most of
the chain extension developed during the time of
the blowing before crystallization. This is the rea-
son for the fair isotropy of the films, which ac-
counts for the mechanical properties. Linear PEs
can also be blown into nearly isotropic films, but
the reasons are quite different. TUR and BUR are
generally the major factors of film texturing. The
common situation, with TUR greater than BUR,

leads to the row structure with the crystalline
lamellae normal to MD. Reducing the TUR/BUR
ratio provides a means of reducing the structural
anisotropy and improving in parallel both the
puncture resistance and tear resistance bal-
ance.18,25,29–31 Unfortunately, this situation is too
far from industrial conditions of film blowing.
However, the deformation path of the molten ma-
terial during tubular blowing is strongly depen-
dant on the processing parameters, such as the
stress, air velocity, and freeze-line height. Those
parameters may be adjusted for re-equilibrating
the difference of chain extension induced by the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. The deforma-
tion path can notably be modified by changes in
the freeze-line height.28,30,31,52,53 Therefore, the
shape of the bubble in the deformation zone be-
tween the die and the crystallization line may
have the form of either a bowl or a stemmed
glass,52 depending on whether film stretching
along MD and TD takes place in a simultaneous
or sequential manner, respectively. This involves
a modification of the molecular extension pro-
cesses and notably enables a more important re-
laxation-induced rearrangement of the chains in
the direction in which chain extension occurred
first.30,31,53 This was the way used by Lu et al.31 to
reverse the MD-to-TD tear resistance ratio for
HDPE films for the same TUR/BUR ratio of ap-
proximately 8. Despite this high TUR/BUR ratio,
the authors showed that increasing the time al-
lowed for MD chain relaxation involved a higher
level of TD chain extension in comparison with
MD, as revealed by the MD and TD tensile draw-
ing curves.31 This resulted in an unusual greater
tear resistance for linear PE in MD than in TD.

Some authors have claimed that isotropy is
favorable for film use properties.10,18,19 However,
it seems that the so-called isotropy of the films,
judged either from two-dimensional structural
studies in the plane of the film or from the com-
parison of MD and TD mechanical properties,
might be, in fact, an orthotropy. Only metallocene
PEs really display isotropy, regardless of blowing
conditions, because of relaxation times much
shorter than those for conventional linear or
branched LDPE at an equivalent melt-flow index
(MFI).

CONCLUSIONS

The tear and puncture resistance of films largely
depend on the processing-induced texture. M-

338 GUICHON ET AL.

LLDPE has a very short relaxation time in the
melt in comparison with the time that the mate-
rial remains in the molten state between the die
and the frost line. This enables the chains
stretched by the blow-up and take-up to relax to a
nearly isotropic state. This almost annihilates
film texturing and imparts better dart impact
performances in comparison with those of ZN-
LLDPE and HP-LDPE. The slightly higher strain
hardening of M-LLDPE, which is ascribed to a
very small number of LCBs, also contributes to its
high puncture resistance.

The better use properties of ZN-LLDPE in com-
parison with those of HP-LDPE are assigned to
better chain intertwining and higher strain hard-
ening in the solid state. The opposite behavior of
the two materials with respect to the unbalanced
tear resistance of the films is ascribed to the chain
architecture: linear chains mainly unfold along
MD for ZN-LLDPE, whereas chains with LCBs
unfold along both MD and TD for HP-LDPE.

Even though M-LLDPE provides the best com-
promise of maximum puncture resistance and
quite high and well-equilibrated tear resistance,
it is not as good as ZN-LLDPE with respect to the
tear resistance level. This is attributed to the
nearly isotropic structure with an almost random
chain distribution, which reduces the probability
of chain segments lying within the film plane.
These segments are the ones most prone to stop
crack propagation. It is, therefore, suggested that
orthotropy, with some degree of chain extension
within the film plane, would be the better texture
for optimized tear and puncture resistance for
either ZN-LLDPE or M-LLDPE. HP-LDPE will
never reach equivalent use properties because it
lacks strain hardening.

The generalization of our conclusions to all
kinds of PEs produced by similar polymerization
methods cannot be made without precautions.
However, a general conclusion is that the average
relaxation time in the melt is a major factor for
the development of texture and mechanical an-
isotropy. This may help us to understand some of
the specific properties reported in the literature,
notably in consideration of the time allowed to the
various sequences of the blowing process. The
knowledge of a whole distribution of relaxation
times, in combination with a complete molecular
characterization, would be a promising way to
progress into the structure–property relation-
ships of PE films.

Available online 12 July 2005 Abstract

Three nearly identical linear low density polyethylene resins based on copolymers of ethylene with 1-butene (B), 1-hexene (H) and

1-octene (O) were utilized to investigate the effect of short chain branch length on the mechanical properties of blown and compression

molded (quenched and slow cooled) films. The content of short chain comononer in the three copolymers was ca. 2.5–2.9 mol% that

corresponded to a density of 0.917–0.918 g/cm3. Within a given series, the tensile properties of these films do not show any significant

difference at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min), even though the DSC and TREF profiles of ‘H’ and ‘O’ differed slightly in

comparison to ‘B’. However, at higher deformation rates (ca. 1 m/s), the breaking strength of these films was found to increase with

increasing short chain branch length. In addition, the Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength of the blown films were also observed to

increase with increasing short chain branch length. Further, dart impact strength and high-speed puncture resistance (5.1 m/s) of 1-octene and

1-hexene based samples was also observed to be higher than that based on 1-butene. The blown films displayed low and comparable levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and crystalline orientation by wide angle X-ray scattering. This confirms that the differences in mechanical

properties in the blown film series are not attributable to differences in molecular orientation. The deformation behavior of both the

compression molded and blown films were also investigated in a well-defined controlled regime by analyzing their essential work of fracture.

It was found that the essential work of fracture of films based on 1-hexene and 1-octene was higher than that of films based on 1-butene. While

the origin of these differences in mechanical properties with increasing short chain branch length is not fully understood, the present

investigation confirms this effect to be pronounced at high deformation rates for both the blown and compression molded quenched films.

1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, etc. The

a-olefin, present in small amounts in the copolymer,

backbone; for instance, the three particularly common

comonomers, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene addressed in

this report introduce ethyl, butyl and hexyl branches,

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378820films. As will be reviewed below, many studies have

attempted to address this same topic but in doing so, many

important and influential parameterswere not necessarily well

controlled in the respective investigations. We believe the

present report has improved on this aspect aswill be discussed.

LLDPE resins are typically produced using Ziegler Natta

heterogeneous catalysts, whose origins can be traced back to

the late 1950s [1]. However, the resins produced by these

catalysts are characterized by considerable heterogeneity in

their microstructure and melting behavior and are con-

sidered to be a mixture of fractions of polyethylene

copolymers with a range of molecular weights and short

chain branch content. In the mid 1990s, with the commercial

advent of high efficiency single site metallocene catalysts,

narrow molecular weight distribution LLDPEs with con-

siderably more homogenous distribution of short chain

branches were produced. Metallocene-based LLDPE resins

have now been commercialized using various different

catalyst technologies [2–6]. The single site metallocene

catalysts produce copolymers that have much narrower

molecular weight distributions (ca. 2–3) and a greater

uniformity in the distribution of the short chain branching

across the width of the molecular weight distribution

relative to the Ziegler Natta catalyzed systems.

LLDPE resins of all types constitute a major segment of

the polyethylene (PE) blown film market worldwide. It is

known that the mechanical properties of the LLDPE films

are influenced by molecular structural parameters such as

molecular weight, molecular weight distribution in addition

to the amount as well as the short chain branch distribution

(SCBD) across the width of the copolymer molecular

weight distribution. Morphological features such as degree

of crystallinity, intercrystalline connectivity and preferred

orientation are also strongly believed to have an effect of the

mechanical properties of blown LLDPE films [7–19].

Short chain branching critically affects the crystallinity

and thus the morphology and consequently the solid-state

properties of the corresponding LLDPE films. As a result, a

broad range of properties of LLDPEs can be obtained by

varying the amount of SCB and the SCBD. In addition, the

length of the short chain branch may also play an important

role in governing the mechanical properties—the specific

issue that will be addressed in this study. Early on, Cady

[20] investigated the effects of the type of short chain

branching (SCB) and SCBD on the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strength of blown films of LLDPEs based

on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene that were synthesized

using Zeigler Natta catalyst chemistry. For similar density

and melt flow index, the 1-butene based resins performed

poorly in comparison to those based on 1-hexene and

1-octene, even though it had a more homogenous SCBD.

However, comparison of two different 1-octene based resins

that differed in their SCBD indicated better mechanical

performance for the 1-octene based resin that had a more

homogenous SCBD. No comment was made on the relative

amounts of the short chain branching in each of the resins, %

crystallinity or orientation of the blown films. However, it

was concluded that the combination of the short chain

branch length and a more homogenous SCBD leads to better

mechanical properties of LLDPE blown films. In a similar

study utilizing LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene that had densities in the range of 0.919– 0.921 g/cm3, melt flow indices of 0.9–1 dg/min and

polydispersities of 3.3–4.1, Liu and Baker [21] observed

the impact strength to increase with increasing short chain

branch length. It was suggested that the longer short chain

branches lead to a larger fraction of tie molecules in the

interlamellar region that causes the observed increase in

impact strength. However, in this study as well, both the

comonomer content and the SCBD varied simultaneously,

thereby making the interpretation of the corresponding

effects uncertain. In a third study, Kim and Park [22] observed

a similar trend for Zeigler-Natta catalyzed 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene based LLDPE blown films that had relatively

larger polydispersities (w6), varying comonomer compo-

sition (4.3, 3.7 and 2.8 mol% of 1-butene, 1-hexene and

1-octene, respectively) and varying branch density (21, 17 and

13 CH3/1000 C for 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene based

resins, respectively). The differences in the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strengths of the blown films based on the three

resins were attributed to the differences in short chain

branching distributions and increased imperfections in the

crystallographic order and decreased lamellar thickness

with increasing short chain branch length.

Wolfe [23] studied the effect of comonomer type on the

slow crack growth resistance of high-density polyethylene

using the PENT (ASTM F1473) test. Of the two

comonomers investigated (‘B’ and ‘H’), the HDPE based

on 1-hexene failed after 400 h compared to 30 h in the case

of HDPE based on 1-butene. No comment, however, was

made on the molecular weight, distribution of the short

chain branches and orientation of molecular chains in the

pipe resins utilized.

By investigating LLDPE resins based on 1-butene and

1-octene, Kale et al. [24] compared the intrinsic tear

strengths for two sets of resins (each set had two resins

based each on 1-butene and 1-octene) of densities 0.912 and

0.921 g/cm3, respectively. The resins had similar poly-

dispersities (2.12–2.25), melt flow indices (0.93–1.02) but

different short chain branch comonomer content. For the

0.912 g/cm3 set of resins, the mol% of 1-butene was 4.17 and that of 1-octene was 3.04; for the 0.921 g/cm3 set of

resins, these were 3.04 and 1.77 mol%, respectively, for

1-butene and 1-octene. Despite the differences in their

comonomer content and the lack of information on the

SCBD, the higher intrinsic tear strength of the 1-octene

based LLDPE resins relative to the 1-butene based resins

was speculated to be due to enhanced tie molecule

formation with increasing short chain branch length.

Further, the observed difference in the melting point versus

mole fraction comonomer relationships for 1-butene and

1-octene based LLDPE resins was suggested to be due to the












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8821incorporation of small amounts of 1-butene into the

crystalline phase and/or variations in the commoner

sequence distributions. However, Alizadeh et al. [25] and

Alamo et al. [26] have shown that the melting point

depression with increasing mole fraction of the short chain

branch comonomer is independent of the type of the

comonomer, i.e. at any given mole fraction of 1-butene,

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene in metallocene catalyzed

copolymers with polyethylene, the melting point depression

of all these copolymers was observed to be comparable.

Further, Alizadeh et al. [25] observed that at any given

mol% of the short chain branch comonomer, the degree of

crystallinity was also very comparable for LLDPE based on

1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. These obser-

vations clearly suggest that the degree/probability of branch

exclusion from the lamellar crystal is independent of the

comonomer type, viz. 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Therefore, in turn, one would expect no differences in tie

molecule formation for the three LLDPE materials based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Kennedy et al. [27] also studied the tensile stress–strain

behavior of metallocene catalyzed LLDPE resins based on

1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-methyl-1-pentene. It

was observed that the nominal-stress strain curves, that were

measured at low deformation rate of 0.0004 m/s (1 in./min)

compared to high deformation rates involved during the

impact (0.2–4 m/s) and Elmendorf tear testing (0.1–7 m/s),

were dominated by strain hardening for all the LLDPEs

resins excepting those based on 1-butene. The yield stress

and initial modulus were related to the degree of crystal-

linity regardless of the short chain branch comonomer.

More importantly, for the highest molecular weights studied

(MwO100,000 g/mol) the force-elongation curves

(recorded at low deformation rates of 0.0004 m/s) for the

four resins were observed to be similar to one another for the

same short chain branch content. This last observation is

important for until the present report, the tensile stress strain

behavior of LLDPE resins, particularly based on 1-butene,

1-hexene or 1-octene, have not been systematically studied

at high deformation rates similar to those involved in dart or

Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength testing. In

addition, the dart or Spencer impact strength and Elmendorf

tear resistance measurements, although standard ASTM

measurements in industry are characterized by non-uniform

deformation rates.

It is important to note that most of the studies that relate

to the influence exerted by the branch length involve

comparisons of LLDPE films from resins that either have

different short chain branch contents, different comonomer

distribution profile (SCBD), different polydispersities or

different short chain branch density on the main ethylene

backbone. As a result, it is extremely difficult to properly

interpret the results and separate the effects of the individual

parameters (mentioned above) on the physical properties of

LLDPE resins due to their simultaneous variation. Thus, in

this study, three LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene, that have been carefully synthesized [28] using the same single site metallocene based catalyst, were

examined to specifically investigate the effect of the

comonomer type (short chain branch length), viz.

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene on the mechanical proper-

ties of blown and compression molded LLDPE films. As

will be discussed later, these three resins were very

comparable in terms of their molecular, rheological,

comonomer content and SCBD aspects. As a result, any

differences arising out of structural differences from other

origins, while not fully eliminated, were minimized. Results

from the earlier study [28] showed that while the tensile

properties, at nominal deformation rates, of the blown films

were indistinguishable, the Elmendorf tear, dart impact and

Spencer impact properties of the 1-butene based films were

significantly lower than the corresponding 1-hexene and

1-octene based films. The difference between 1-hexene and

1-octene films was much smaller with a slight advantage for

the 1-octene films. In this study, we attempt to further

investigate the effect of the type of the short chain branch on

the mechanical properties of LLDPE films since other

parameters (like comonomer content, SCBD, molecular

weight, molecular weight distribution, polydispersity and

density) were established to be essentially constant [28].

The mechanical properties were measured utilizing Spencer

impact, Elmendorf tear resistance and high-speed puncture

resistance measurements as well as in a controlled tensile

deformation regime by utilizing the essential work of

fracture methodology/technique.

2. Essential work of fracture (EWF)

Recent studies have indicated that the EWF procedure is

a very useful method to study the fracture properties of thin

films and ductile materials [29–33]. The concept of EWF

was developed initially by Cotterell and Reddel [34] on the

basis of ideas proposed by Broberg [35], who suggested that

the total work of fracture (Wf) dissipated in a precracked

specimen could be represented as a sum of the work

consumed into two distinct zones. As shown in Fig. 1, the

double-edge-notched-tension (DENT) specimen that is

precracked along the horizontal (inwards from the vertical

edges) to leave a ligament region ‘l’ that undergoes the actual

deformation in tension under a load ‘F’ along the vertical.

The regions marked as ‘1’ and ‘2’ depict the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and the outer plastic zone, respectively, (OPZ).

The work dissipated in the FPZ corresponds to the

essential work of fracture (We); and the work required to

yield the material in the OPZ is the non-essential work of

fracture (Wp) that depends on the geometry of the specimen

tested. Thus, the total fracture energy is expressed as (more

details are provided elsewhere [34]):

Fig. 1. Sample geometry utilized in the double edge notched tension

(DENT) mode. The zones marked with 1 and 2 indicate the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and outer plastic zone (OPZ), respectively. The ligament length

(denoted as ‘l’) in the present study was 1, 2 or 3 mm.

ligament area), wp is the specific non-essential work of

fracture (per unit volume), l is the ligament length, t is the

specimen thickness and b is the plastic zone shape factor.

The total specific work of fracture is represented by:

wf Z
Wf

lt
Zwe Cbwpl (2) From Eq. (2), it is clear that wf has a linear relationship with

the ligament length. In other words, a plot of the wf as a

function of l should be linear with the intercept on the

ordinate axis and the slope providing we and bwp,

respectively. Thus, this method involves testing of speci-

mens that have different ligament lengths, and then

evaluating the Wf for each specimen (area under the

force–displacement curve) followed by suitable normal-

ization with respect to the ligament area to give a plot of wf

vs. l. The best-fit regression line would then give the slope

(bwp) and intercept (we).

When plane stress conditions prevail for all ligament

lengths, it is assumed [36] that we is a material property (a

constant) at a given thickness. Mathematically, for plane

stress conditions, the following two relationships should be

satisfied:

(4)

Under these conditions, it has been demonstrated theoreti-

cally [37] and supported experimentally [37–39] that we is

equivalent to Jc, or the J-integral. For a nonlinear elastic

body containing a precrack and undergoing deformation, Jc
represents the strain energy release rate of nonlinear elastic

materials and is given by: [40] JC ZK
dU

dA
(5)

where U is the potential energy (also the difference between

the strain energy stored in the body and the work done by

external forces of deformation) and A is the crack area. It

can be seen that the units of Jc are also energy/area (the

same as we). Thus, the advantage of the EWF method is its

experimental simplicity as compared to the J-integral

procedure.

3. Experimental

3.1. Material synthesis

The three LLDPE copolymers (based on ethylene-co-1- butene, ‘B’, ethylene-co-1-hexene, ‘H’, and ethylene-co-1- octene, ‘O’) used in this study were synthesized by using a

Chevron Phillips’ proprietary zirconium based metallocene

catalyst [28]. The copolymerization was conducted in a pilot

plant at Chevron Phillips under steady state slurry-loop

copolymerization conditions. The comonomers and the

catalyst were fed continuously and the polymer fluff was

continuously removed from the reactor. The fluff was

purged with nitrogen to remove residual solvent and

unreacted olefins followed by blending with antioxidants

and a processing aid. The polymers were then extruded into

pellets.

3.2. Characterization of the resins

The molecular, rheological and branching characteristics

of the three resins are listed in Table 1. The rheological data

were obtained using a Rheometrics Scientific Inc., ARES

rheometer. Small strain (10%) oscillatory measurements

across a frequency range of 0.03–95 rad/s were made at

190 8C under a nitrogen blanket. The resulting complex

viscosity versus frequency data was fitted using the modi-

fied Carreau–Yasuda (CY) empirical model [41,42] to

obtain the zero shear viscosity (h0). The molecular weight,










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8823and the molecular weight distribution were determined by

gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Nuclear magnetic

resonance (NMR) was utilized to determine the amount of

comonomer and thus the short chain branching incorporated

into the respective copolymers. The experimental proce-

dures of these two techniques are outlined in detail else-

where [43]. In addition, the comonomer composition

distribution across the molecular weight distribution of

these three copolymers was determined by a recently deve-

loped chemometric technique [44] based on size exclusion

chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectros-

copy (SEC–FTIR).

Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) was

performed on the three resins to determine the homogeneity

of incorporation of SCB in the copolymers. This was done

by using a triple detector TREF instrument which was

assembled using parts retro-fitted into a Waters 150C GPC

system. The column (12.55 mm ID and 150 mm in length)

was packed with #30 stainless steel shot (Vulcan Blast Shot

Technology, Brantfor, Ont., Canada). The oven heater pro-

vided programmed cooling and heating in the 35–150 8C range. It was controlled externally via West 4400 set point

programmer. Three detectors, viz. a Foxboro infrared (IR)

(3.4 nm), a Viscotek 150R viscometer and a PDI 15 and

90-degree dual-angle light scattering detector, were utilized

for characterization. The viscometer and the light scattering

detector were housed in the same oven while the IR cell was

heated separately. Sample solutions were prepared in the

carrier solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), at 3 mg/mL.

In the experiment, 500 mL of the sample solution was

injected onto the column at 150 8C and subsequently cooled

to 35 8C at a rate of 0.72 8C/min, to allow slow and complete

crystallization. The column was then slowly re-heated to

150 8C at a rate of 1.5 8C/min with a solvent flow rate

of 0.5 mL/min, during which the polymer molecules

re-dissolved and eluted out into the three detectors. Analysis

of the data obtained from the IR detector was done to get

normalized weight fraction of the fractionated copolymer as

a function of the temperature.

3.3. Film preparation

Blown films were made from each of the three resins

under the following conditions: 100 mm (4 in.) die diameter,

1.5 mm die gap, 37.5 mm diameter single-screw extruder

(L/DZ24, compression ratio 2.2:1), 115 rpm screw speed (ca.

27 kg/h output rate), 2.5:1 blow up ratio (BUR) and barrel and

die temperatures set to 190 8C. The freeze line height (FLH)

was between 20 and 28 cm and cooling was accomplished

with a dual lip air ring using ambient air that had a temperature

of ca. 20 8C. Films with different thicknesses (12.5–100 mm
or 0.5–4 mil) were produced this way. These conditions are

representative of typical commercial scale LLDPE blown

film processing according to scaling procedures established

previously [45].

In addition to these blown films, unoriented quenched

and slow cooled compression molded films were also pro-

duced. Preweighed amounts of the copolymer pellets were

melted in a mold at 150 8C for 10 min followed by the

application of 3000 lb f (ca. 1350 kg f) for 5 min. Quenched

(Q) samples were prepared by being removed from the

heater plates followed by being placed on a wooden labora-

tory bench and exposed to ambient conditions. The samples

took ca. 5 min to cool to ambient temperature (ca. 20 8C).

For the slow cooled (SC) samples, the mold containing the

molten film was allowed to remain between the heater plates

after the pressure was released. The power to the heater

plates was then turned off to allow slow cooling of the films.

The samples attained room temperature in ca. 8 h. Both the

Q and SC films were ca. 125 mm (5 mil) in thickness.

3.4. Film characterization

The blown films of different thicknesses were tested for

their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and

Elmendorf tear resistance according to ASTM D-1709 (method A), ASTM D-3420 (although a special in-house

pendulum was utilized to ensure failures) and ASTM

D-1922 standards, respectively, at ambient conditions. In

addition, high-speed puncture resistance of the LLDPE

copolymers, at a high impact velocity (5.1 m/s), was also

investigated. For this test, quenched compression molded

and slow cooled plaques of approximately 3.35 mm

thickness were employed. The compression molded speci-

mens (corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) were clamped in a

circular fixture that is 76 mm in diameter. A 23.76 kg mass

tup/dart (13 mm diameter hemispherical end) was dropped

on the clamped specimens at an impact velocity of 5.1 m/s

(corresponding to a drop height of 1 m). The direction of

impact was parallel to the specimen thickness, and the point

of impact was at the center of the clamped specimen. The

tup/dart was equipped with a load sensor to measure the load

response as a function of time, during the impact event. A

separate photo sensor provided a measurement of the initial

impact velocity. At a given weight of the tup/dart assembly

and its impact velocity, the specimen load-deflection data

for the impact event was recorded. Total energy (J) to

rupture as measured from the load-deflection curve was

used to characterize the impact performance. The quantities

(energy to rupture) measured from this test are not fixed

material properties as they depend on the test specimen size

(thickness) and the specific test conditions.

Blown films that were 25 mm in thickness (each from

resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) in

addition to the compression molded films were chosen for

the rest of the characterization methods utilized including

refractive index measurements, differential scanning calori-

metry (DSC) and essential work of fracture analysis. Flat

plate wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of the

blown films were obtained at ambient conditions using a

Philips PW1720 X-ray generator. Four layers of each of

the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown film (based on 1-butene,












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–883788241-hexene and 1-octene) were carefully aligned and stacked

on the sample holder to obtain sufficient scattering intensity

for exposure of the WAXS pattern at 40 kV, 20 mA and 4 h.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 5 cm. The X-ray

beam was parallel to the normal of the sample plane.

Pin-hole collimated small-angle X-ray scattering

(SAXS) profiles of compression molded films were

collected at ambient temperature using a Rigaku Ultrax18 rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and

60 mA. A pyrolytic graphite monochromator was used to

filter out all radiation except the Cu Ka doublet, with an

average wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The camera used 200, 100 and 300 nm pinholes for X-ray collimation. Two-dimen-

sional data sets were collected using a molecular metrology

2D multi-wire area detector, located ca. 65 cm from the

sample. After azimuthal averaging, the raw data was

corrected for detector noise, absorption, and background

noise. The data were then placed on an absolute scale using

a type 2 glassy carbon sample 1.07 mm thickness,

previously calibrated at the advanced photon source at the

Argonne National Laboratory, as a secondary standard. All

the SAXS profiles presented have been masked in the low

scattering vector region where the beam stop influenced the

profiles.

Refractive index measurements were conducted at

ambient conditions on all the compression molded films

and the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films using a Metricon

Prism coupler Model 2010 along the three coordinates.

Measurements in the normal (ND), machine (MD) and

transverse direction (TD) were recorded. An average of 3–5 measurements was reported in each direction. Thermal

behavior was investigated on a Seiko SSC/5200 DSC. The

heating and cooling traces were recorded at 20 8C/min in a

nitrogen-purged atmosphere to study the melting and

crystallization of these samples. Small angle light scattering

(SALS) patterns in the Hn configuration were recorded at

ambient conditions by utilizing a He–Ne laser at 633 nm.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 11 cm.

Crystalline, amorphous and interfacial contents in

compression molded films were estimated by analyzing

the free induction decay (FID) data obtained from NMR

(method described below), although Alamo et al. [26] and

Mandelkern et al. [46,47] have utilized a different method

involving analysis of Raman spectra on LLDPEs based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In the present study, all

NMR measurements on compression molded films were

made using an Auburn IMR analyzer operating at 20 MHz.

Morphological analysis was accomplished by fitting the free

induction decay (FID) to a three-component model, viz.

crystalline, amorphous and interfacial. The data was

obtained using a 908 pulse (2 ms), 1 s pulse delay (which

was much greater than five times T1) and a 17 ms dead time

to eliminate signal contamination from the probe ring down.

Each FID consisted of 300 points, where each data point

was sampled every 1 ms, with 160 transients acquired to

improve signal-to-noise. The model utilized to fit the data

was based on the procedure suggested by Kristiansen [48].

where a is related to the hydrogen–hydrogen distance and b

is related to the width of Gaussian broadening. Since, a and

b are associated with the crystalline domain, and more

specifically a function of the hydrogen–hydrogen distance,

these two parameters are expected to be constant. Therefore,

a series of ten resins with densities from 0.918 to 0.960 were

analyzed. The values found for a and b did not vary much

and average values obtained were: aZ1.070eC05, bZ
72,940. These were used in all the fits reported in this study.

The two functions C[x] and S[x] are also referred as Fresnell

functions.

The best fit of the signal intensity–time relationship for

the hydrogen nuclei located in the non-crystalline domains,

viz. interfacial and amorphous, can be expressed as the

where two separate sets of values of the pre-exponential

factor, A, spin–spin relaxation time, T2, and the Weilbullian

factor, d, were utilized for amorphous and interfacial

domains, respectively. The three equations were then solved

simultaneously by putting the FID data into an Excel

spreadsheet and using Microsoft Solver to find the best least

squared fit between the experimental data and the model.

Tensile stress–strain curves were recorded at 1 m/s on a

specialized MTS system 810. The servohydraulic actuator

was operated in displacement control. The force transducer

(Kistler 9712B50) was mounted directly to the crosshead.

The force signal was amplified with a Kistler 5010B and

acquired with a Nicolet Integra oscilloscope at data

acquisition rates of 10–40 kHz, depending on specimen

type. The specimen geometry utilized for tensile tests was

rectangular, 75!17 mm2. The distance between the jaws of

the tensile tester was 10 mm. For the DENT mode,

specimens of 25.4!25.4 mm2 (1!1 in.2) with ligament

lengths of 1, 2 and 3 mmwere tested at 1 m/s. It is noted that

for blown films, the specimens deformed in the MD

direction are representative of the measurement in the TD

as the crack propagates in the TD. Likewise, the samples

deformed in the TD are representative of the measurements

in the MD. Thus, the EWF results for blown films are

reported corresponding to the direction of the propagation of

the crack. For a thorough regressional analysis, at least five

specimens were tested at each ligament length. Prior to












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8825testing, the specimens were weighed to compute the average

thickness of the film in the ligament region. Individual

force–displacement curves were integrated by a computer

program to calculate the total fracture energy. This was then

normalized by the area of the ligament to provide the

specific fracture energy (wf) and then plotted against the

ligament length (l). Regression analysis of this data was

performed to obtain the values of the intercept which equals

the essential work of fracture, we.

4. Results and discussion

As can be seen in Table 1, the three copolymers (‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’) are essentially identical in their basic molecular

and rheological characteristics. These three resins have a

very similar melt flow index (1.01–1.09 g/10 min) and

density (0.917–0.918 g/cm3). The number average (Mn) and

weight average molecular weight (Mw) obtained from the

GPC are nearly identical (43.2–44.2 and 97.9–99 kg/mol,

respectively). The GPC curves for each of the three resins,

as shown in Fig. 2 are also comparable. This behavior is

further supported by very similar zero shear rate viscosity

values (7.13–7.26 kPa s). The polydispersity (2.22–2.27),

that reflects the breadth of the molecular weight distribution,

and the total comonomer content (2.47–2.95 mol%), as

obtained by NMR, is also very similar for each of these three

resins. The NMR data also indicate the presence of small

levels of ethyl branches in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resin (0.12 and

0.15 mol%, respectively). This is due to the generation of a

small level of ‘in situ’ ethyl branches that are indistinguish-

able from the ethyl branches introduced by 1-butene in the

copolymerization of ‘B’ copolymer. For the ‘H’ and ‘O’

resins, these ethyl branches were detected by NMR in

addition to the butyl and hexyl branches, respectively. Thus,
Fig. 2. Molecular weight distribution and the number of short chain

branches (corresponding to each resin) per 1000 carbon atoms of the

backbone of the three LLDPE resins (indicated on the secondary ordinate

axis).
the total mol% reported in Table 1 reflects the total amount

of short chain branches (including the very small amount of

ethyl branches in addition to the butyl or hexyl branches,

respectively, for the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resins). Nevertheless, the

total comononer content ([X] mol%) required to make a

0.918 g/cm3 density is somewhat higher for the 1-butene

copolymer than those based on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The

short chain branching distribution data is plotted in Fig. 2 (secondary ordinate axis). The number of short chain

branches/1000 C atoms in each of three resins is essentially

uniform (9–11/1000 C) across the width of the molecular

weight distribution. Despite some scatter at the low and

high-end of the molecular weight distribution that is

attributed to higher error in the measurements [44], the

three copolymer resins indicate a similar SCBD. Another

parameter that indicates the uniformity of the distribution of

short chain branches across the MWD is the % relative

monomer dispersity (%RMD) index, as determined by

solution NMR [51,52]. RMD is the tendency of the

comonomer units to be either ‘isolated’ (%RMDZ100) or

‘clustered’ (%RMD!100). The values of the three resins

utilized in this study are essentially the same, viz. 99.1, 99.7 and 99.3% for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively.

The information from the chemometric technique to

determine the SCBD (as reported in Fig. 2) does not indicate

the distribution of the short chain branches along a given

polymer chain. To ascertain any difference in this

distribution for the three copolymers, TREF was performed

on each of the LLDPE resins. These results are provided in

Fig. 3. All three resins (‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) possess the general

comonomer distribution profile characteristic of the resins

produced by single site metallocene catalysts [53,54]. In the

Ziegler–Natta catalyzed LLDPE resins, a low temperature

peak (between 45 and 55 8C) that is due to the elution of a

soluble fraction heavily concentrated with comonomers and

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378826a broad peak in the 55–80 8C range that is due to the elution

of ‘branched’ fraction made up of polymer molecules of

various comonomer contents are also observed [55].

However, the absence of the low temperature peaks (in

the range of 45–80 8C) in the TREF profiles of metallocene

catalyzed LLDPE resins utilized in this study indicate a

homogenous incorporation of the short chain comonomer in

the linear ethylene backbone as compared to resins

synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysts. A closer inspection

of the three profiles in Fig. 3 indicates some differences that

are most likely attributable to some level of difference in the

SCB distribution (along a given polymer chain) among the

three copolymers utilized in this study. These differences

show that resin ‘B’ has the most homogeneous crystal-

lizability/solubility behavior in comparison to ‘H’ and ‘O’.

These differences were primarily manifested in the ‘second

heating’ DSC results on blown and compression molded

films (results discussed in detail later, Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)),

where the presence of a low temperature shoulder on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ was

observed. This difference in the second melting DSC

behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise

from the slightly more homogenous distribution of SCB

(along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles. However, the SCBD data in

Fig. 2 and the near 100% RMD values of the three resins

indicate that the overall or average SCB distribution across

the MWD is in fact very similar for all three copolymers.

Hence, we believe that the magnitude of any differences that

may be observed in physical properties (discussed later)

cannot simply be attributed to this difference in the TREF

profiles.

The refractive index data on compression molded and

25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films is listed in Table 2. As can

be observed, within a given series (be it quenched, slow

cooled or blown) the average refractive index for the three

resins is essentially the same. As expected, the average

refractive indices of the slow cooled films are somewhat

higher than the corresponding quenched and blown films.

For the blown films, the refractive index was observed to be

slightly higher in the MD than that in TD, as might also be

expected. The difference in the refractive indices in the MD

and TD directions, respectively, nMDKnTD, gives the in-

plane birefringence, Dn. These are listed as well in the

extreme right in Table 2. The small values of Dn do not

indicate a high level of orientation along the MD (in

comparison to that in TD) in these films. The out-of-plane

birefringence, nMDKnND, is 0.0013, 0.0011 and 0.0015 for

‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, respectively. These values are

comparable to the in-plane birefringence, thereby indicating

a slight uniaxial orientation for these blown films. The

WAXS patterns taken with the beam parallel to the sample

film normal are shown in Fig. 4. The intensities of the

(1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections show some azimuthal

dependence, as expected. In particular, the (200) reflections

are slightly lower in intensity at the equator than that at the

meridian, thereby indicating a low a-axis orientation along

the MD. This is a common observation for polyethylene

blown films produced at low stress levels. As expected, the

(110) plane reflections, on the other hand, have a relatively

lower meridianal intensity than that observed equatorially.

Returning to the refractive index data in Table 2, the

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene at a given mol% of the

short chain branch comonomer. Their work did not support

the notion that any of the short chain branches are included

in the crystalline lattice. In the present study, the density and

consequently the %Xc of the blown and quenched films are

lower than the slow cooled samples, as expected.

The lamellar scale lengths in the quenched and slow

cooled compression molded films are indicated by SAXS

results in Fig. 5. As can be seen, within a given series, the

scattering patterns are essentially identical for ‘B’, ‘H’ and

‘O’. It is clear that the differences in TREF profiles in Fig. 3 do not affect the SAXS behavior on the lamellar scale for

both the series investigated (compression molded quenched

and slow cooled). As expected, the long period is larger in

slow cooled films (223 Å) than that in quenched films

(205 Å). In addition, the results from the free induction

decay NMR experiments, that gives information on the














P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378828relative contents of ‘rigid’ (crystalline), ‘intermediate’

(interfacial) and ‘mobile or liquid-like’ (amorphous) phases

indicated that the content of these phases was very similar

for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ within a given series in the compression

molded samples (Fig. 6). For the compression molded

quenched samples, the weight fractions of crystalline,

interfacial and amorphous domains are ca. 59.5, 29.8 and

11.3%, respectively, in ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ films, while the

respective values for the compression molded slow cooled

are 63.1, 24.5 and 12.7%. The calculated crystalline content

in the slow cooled films is larger than for the quenched

films, as expected. However, the interfacial content in the

slow cooled films is slightly less than that in the quenched

films, although the amorphous content is very similar in

both the compression molded series. In general, the values

of crystallinity obtained from free induction decay NMR

tends to be higher than those obtained from DSC. This is due

to the fact that taut tie molecules can also contribute to the

‘rigid’ phase. Very recently, Yoon et al. [58] utilized SAXS

and solid-state NMR method (rotor-encoded rotational echo

double resonance technique) to investigate the structure of

metallocene catalyzed LLDPEs as a function of comonomer

type (1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) and content. They

also did not observe any structural differences in their series

of ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials investigated that had a ca.

3 mol% comonomer content.

Returning to the present study, larger scale lengths at the

micro level for our materials were characterized by SALS.

The spherulitic scale lengths in the compression molded

quenched and slow cooled films are indicated by the Hn

SALS in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the SALS patterns (within a

given series, be it quenched or slow cooled), are similar for

the ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. These ‘four-lobed’ patterns are

characteristic of a spherulitic morphology. However, when

comparing the patterns of the slow cooled with that of the

quenched films, it appears that the slow cooled films have

molded films as determined by free induction decay NMR.
larger but less well-defined spherulitic structures than the

quenched films. This was also supported by the surface

analysis of these films by scanning electron microscopy

(SEM) (results not shown here). The SALS patterns in the

Hn configuration can be utilized to calculate the average size

of the spherulites by use of the following relationship

[59–61]:

 
Z 4:13 (10) where R, is the radius of the spherulites, lm is the

wavelength in the scattering medium and qmax is the angle

of intensity maxima in one of the lobes of the Hn pattern.

The calculated diameter for the quenched films was in the

range of 2.9–3.6 mm (B–Q: 3.3 mm, H–Q: 2.9 mm and O–Q:

3.6 mm) whereas the slow cooled films were in the range of

3.8–4.2 mm (B–SC: 3.8 mm, H–SC: 4.2 mm and O–SC:

4.2 mm). As expected, the size of the spherulites in the slow

cooled films is larger than that in quenched films.

Furthermore, the SEM analysis on these films indicated a

broad distribution of sizes (data not shown).

The first and second DSC heating–cooling profiles of the

blown films are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The

first heating (Fig. 8(a)) is extremely comparable for each of

the three, ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, with melting

transition peaks in the range of 117–119 8C. The first

cooling curves indicate a lower temperature primary

crystallization exotherm peak for ‘B’ (93 8C) than the ‘H’

(95.5 8C), which in turn is slightly lower than ‘O’ (96.5 8C).

It might be postulated that a lower primary crystallization

temperature peak (higher effective degree of undercooling)

indicates crystallization of relatively smaller-sized crystals

as compared to the sample that crystallized at a higher

temperature. The slightly smaller-sized lamellar crystals

should therefore begin to melt at a lower temperature. This

is confirmed by the endotherm peak positions in the second

heating cycles, where ‘B’ shows the peak endotherm at

116.5 8C whereas ‘H’ and ‘O’ show the second melting

endotherm peaks at 117.5 8C. The second heating profiles

are shown in Fig. 8(b). A distinct ‘shoulder’ in the second

cycle melting endotherm at 109–113 8C for the ‘H’ and ‘O’

films (Fig. 8(b)) can be clearly seen in comparison to the ‘B’

film, which does not show a distinct shoulder. This

difference in the second melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise from the more

interchain homogeneity of SCB in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Another noticeable and

identical feature in the first and second cooling curves is the

presence of a small exotherm transition at 63 8C for each of

the three films within a given series, be it blown, quenched

or slow cooled. This secondary crystallization is postulated

to lead to the formation of a second population of lamellar

crystals that are thinner than those formed during the

primary crystallization process at higher temperatures.

The DSC results of the compression molded films are

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8829shown in Fig. 9, where only the heating curves are shown.

Based on the first heating curves (Fig. 9(a)), the melting

peaks of the quenched and slow cooled films are in the range

of 115–117 8C. Only the slow cooled films of ‘H’ and ‘O’

show a slightly broader melting endotherm than that of ‘B’.

These samples were left in the insulated DSC chamber and

allowed to cool down to room temperature in about 2 h after

which they were heated again and the corresponding second

heating curves were recorded (Fig. 9(b)). As can be seen, a

behavior similar to what was observed for the blown films is

noted. Specifically, the presence of a ‘shoulder’ on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ (for both quenched and

slow cooled) is much more distinct and marked as these

samples were cooled very slowly after the first melting (as

against a cooling rate of 20 8C/min for the blown films). As

stated earlier, the slightly broader first melting endotherms

of ‘H’ and ‘O’ than ‘B’ and the difference in the second

melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’

could arise from the slightly more homogenous distribution

of SCB (along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and

‘O’, as indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, it

can be said that the thermal behavior based on the first

heating responses of these films ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ (be it

quenched or blown) are very similar. In the compression

molded slow cooled films, whether the slightly broader first

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ play a role in governing

the mechanical properties at slow deformation rates of these

films will become clear in the following discussion.

The tensile properties of the 25 mm thick blown films and

compression molded films that were measured at slow draw

rates, ca. 0.0004–0.008 m/s, (25–510 mm/min) are shown in

Fig. 10. The yield and breaking strength are essentially the

same for the films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ in each

direction (MD or TD). For the LLDPE blown films, due to

preferential orientation of the lamellar crystals, the TD

modulus tends to be higher than the MD modulus [13].

However, for the films investigated here, the low levels of

orientation translates to the modulus being only marginally

higher along the TD. Likewise, the tensile properties of the

compression molded films (Fig. 10(b)) at conventional draw

rates indicate very comparable yield and breaking strengths

for films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, within a given series.

Within the limits of error, the tensile modulus is also very

similar for films based on three resins in each series. These

results clearly indicate that the slight differences in the

TREF profiles in Fig. 3 and differences in first melting DSC

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films really do

not play any role in governing the mechanical properties

when obtained at slow deformation rates (up to 0.008 m/s).

To ascertain any differences in the tensile properties at

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378830higher deformation rates, the stress strain behavior was

measured at a higher deformation rate of 1 m/s (about two

orders of magnitude higher than before). These results are

shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b) for 25 mm thick blown and

compression molded films. Due to the extremely high rate of

data acquisition, the ‘ringing’ characteristics of the load

path’s mechanical elements (primarily the load cell/grip

assembly) appear as oscillations in the ‘yield’ region of the

curves. However, the yield strength values of both the blown

and compression molded films are readily distinguished,

and all fall in the range of 17–20 MPa. The ‘H’ and ‘O’

blown films also show a higher breaking strain than that for

corresponding ‘B’ films (Fig. 11(a)). Likewise, B–Q and

B–SC underwent failure before yielding or plastic drawing

could take place whereas, with the exception of the ‘O–SC’,

the compression molded ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials yield, draw

and undergo significant post ‘natural draw ratio’ defor-

mation before failure (Fig. 11(b)). A noticeable trend was

observed in the breaking strengths. The breaking strength of

the 1-butene based films (‘B’) is distinctly lower than that

for the 1-hexene (‘H’) and 1-octene (‘O’) based films,

regardless of film type (quenched, slow cooled or blown).

For the blown films, the ‘B’ films have a breaking strength

of ca. 21–24 MPa as compared to that of 31–36 MPa for ‘H’

and ‘O’ films. In either direction (MD or TD) the ‘H’ and

‘O’ films also show distinctly greater strain hardening when

compared to the ‘B’ films, and this accounts for the higher

values of the breaking strengths. Similarly, strain hardening

can be observed in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ compression molded

films. The quenched and slow cooled films of ‘B’ do not

undergo any strain hardening and display much lower

breaking strengths (6–10 MPa) as compared to the high

values of the ‘H’ and ‘O’ films (16–26 MPa). Note that

when the breaking strengths of the compression molded and

blown films corresponding to the same resin are compared,

the blown films have superior properties. Comparing the

results in Figs. 9 and 10, it can be inferred that the breaking

strength of blown films of ‘B’ is lower than that of ‘H’ and

‘O’, an effect that is evident only at high deformation rates.

Further tests conducted on the blown films to measure

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8831their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and

Elmendorf tear properties, where high deformation rates of

0.1–1, 0.1–7 and 0.2–4 m/s, respectively, were utilized, also

confirm this behavior. As shown in Fig. 12, the dart impact

strength, at any given film gage, of ‘B’ is significantly lower

than that of ‘H’ and ‘O’. During the dart impact testing,

some of the films, especially at higher gage, did not rupture

at the maximum allowable force corresponding to the

falling dart of 1400 g. Hence, those values are reported as

‘O1400 g’ in Fig. 12. Turning to the results in Fig. 13(a)

and (b), it is clearly noted that Elmendorf tear and Spencer

impact strength increase with increasing short chain branch

length at any given blown film thickness. Furthermore,

within samples of the same copolymer type (‘B’, ‘H’ or ‘O’)

these properties increase with increasing blown film

thickness, as would be expected. Of particular importance

is that for any given direction (MD or TD), the Elmendorf

tear strength and Spencer impact strength increase in the

order: ‘O’O‘H’O‘B’. The results of the puncture resistance

measurements on compression molded quenched and slow

cooled plaques are given in Fig. 14, which again support that

the materials based on 1-butene are inferior to those based

on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The load-deformation curves are

plotted in Fig. 14(a) for the representative samples

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively, in each

series (quenched and slow cooled). Five specimens

(quenched and slow cooled) were tested (load-deformation

curves of representative specimens shown Fig. 14(a)). The

results indicated a good reproducibility for each material

type. The average integrated energy to rupture and the

deformation to failure are plotted in Fig. 14(b). As can be

seen, within a given series, be it quenched and slow cooled,

the total deformation to failure (plotted on the secondary

axis of Fig. 14(b)), of ‘H’ and ‘O’ is higher than that of ‘B’,

indicating an increased ductile failure in ‘H’ and ‘O’. This

was also confirmed visually by the fact that the deformed

‘H’ and ‘O’ samples had a longer and ductile sleeve

(relative to that in ‘B’) that emanated from the region where

the mechanically driven tup exited the sample. This is also

reflected as higher total rupture energies for ‘H’ and ‘O’

(55–61 J) than ‘B’ (30–37 J). However, in all these tests,

viz. dart impact, Spencer impact and Elmendorf Tear the

rate of deformation of the films is not well-defined. In a dart

impact measurement, a falling dart ruptures the film held in

tension and the equivalent force to rupture is recorded in

terms of the mass of the falling dart. In the case of the

Spencer impact strength measurements, a piece of film is

held in tension and punctured with a hemispherical head

attached to a swinging pendulum whereas in Elmendorf tear

resistance, the precut film sample is ruptured by a swinging

pendulum. In the puncture resistance measurements the

sample is held in tension and punctured by a pneumatically

driven tup/dart. In either configuration, the deformation rate

of the film can be visualized to be a maximum at the

initiation (when the pendulum or the ball/dart hits the film)

and then decreases thereafter as the crack progresses (as

most of the energy carried by the pendulum or the ball/dart

has already been spent in overcoming the initial resistance).

Thus, the rates of deformation (reported above) are at best

estimates and never an exact value, as the deformation

process of the samples is not well-controlled.

To characterize the deformation of the films in a more

well-defined extensional regime, tear resistance properties

were measured by utilizing the essential work of fracture

(recall earlier discussion of this methodology). Here, precut

films that have a specified ligament length were deformed

in a tensile manner at 1 m/s to investigate their tear

resistance properties. A typical stress–displacement behav-

ior for the blown film based on resin ‘H’ is shown for two

ligament lengths, viz. 1 and 3 mm in Fig. 15(a) and (b).

(corresponding to each ligament length and marked as i, ii, iii and iv) are

shown to indicate reproducibility.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8833Three stress–displacement curves (marked as i, ii and iii)

corresponding to three specimens (with the same ligament

length) are shown to indicate the reproducibility in the data.

The tear specimens satisfy the plane stress conditions [Eqs.

(3) and (4) in Section 2] and fail right after the yield and do

not undergo any plastic stretching that is characteristic of

the samples in a conventional tensile deformation test.

Further, the larger ligament length specimens had a larger

strain at break. This is due to the fact that at larger ligament

lengths, there is more material in the ligament that

undergoes deformation in comparison to that in the smaller

ligament lengths. However, the yield stress is practically the

same at both the ligament lengths, as expected. Stress–

displacement curves were obtained in a similar fashion for

the 25 mm thick blown films of ‘B’ and ‘O’ and all the

compression molded films. Based on the procedure outlined

in Section 2, the specific fracture energy, obtained by

integrating the stress–strain curve, was fitted by a linear

relationship when plotted against the ligament length. The

intercepts of these plots, then gave the essential work of

fracture. These results are shown in Fig. 16. For the blown

films (Fig. 16(a)) in each of the direction (MD or TD), the

essential work of fracture is observed to increase with

increasing short chain branch length, a result consistent with

the impact strength and Elmendorf tear resistance measure-

ments. As stated before, when a blown film specimen is

stretched along the MD, the crack propagates along the TD.

Therefore, when the specimen is being stretched along the

MD, the measured EWF is representative of the TD

direction. Consequently, the EWF along the TD is greater

than that along the MD. This is consistent with the tear

resistance being greater along the TD than along the MD

(Fig. 13(a)), which in turn is a manifestation of the preferred

lamellar orientation [13,14] (although only slight in this

study). For the compression molded quenched films

(Fig. 16(b)), the essential work of fracture of films based

on 1-butene was also observed to be less than that of the

1-hexene and 1-octene films. However, within the limits of

experimental error, the EWF results of the slow cooled films

do not indicate a strong dependence on the short chain












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378834branch length. Thus, based on the results discussed so far, it

can be inferred that the mechanical properties of the films of

the three essentially identical linear low density polyethy-

lene copolymers based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene

show a dependence on the length of short chain branch only

at high rates of deformation. This is summarized in Table 3, where at slower rates of deformation, the mechanical

properties were observed to be similar but quite different at

higher deformation rates. This is due to the fact that these

films are very similar in their molecular, rheological and

structural aspects that any effects due to the different short

chain lengths (present in small amounts of ca. 2.5–3 mol%)

do not get reflected at slower deformation rates. However, at

high deformation rates, these effects become prominent

such that the mechanical properties of films based on

1-butene were observed to be lower than those based on

1-hexene and 1-octene. Recalling that the primary objective

of this study was to further investigate the effect of the

length of short chain branch on the physical properties of

LLDPEs, the results presented here have shown that the

length of the short chain branch does play an important role

in influencing the mechanical properties of the LLDPEs in

agreement with earlier results [28] and furthermore

established that this effect is pronounced only at high rates

of deformation.

With regards to the origin of the effect of the difference in

short chain branch length on the mechanical properties

when measured at high rates of deformation, it seems

difficult to attribute this to the amorphous phase in view of

the low mole percentage of the branches and the fact that the

rheological behavior of at least the melt state shows no

significant differences. We did investigate the DMA

(dynamic mechanical analysis) behavior of the film

materials (data not shown) but did not find any distinct

variations between the materials although we admit that the

DMA tests were determined in the lower frequency range

(0.001–10 Hz). We conjecture that the origin of the effect of

the difference in short chain branch length on the

mechanical properties is coupled to its influence on the

deformation behavior of the crystalline phase. It has been

speculated [21,24,62,63] that a short chain branch prevents

the formation of crystalline regions in its immediate vicinity

leading to an increased probability of the main chain to

which it is attached to be incorporated into two different

lamellae, thereby establishing that portion of the chain as a

bridge or a tie molecule. If this supposition is true, then the

enhanced properties, associated with plastic deformation

(ductility, toughness, tear resistance, etc.), could be due to

an increasing number of tie molecules with increasing molar

content of short chain branches. However, this postulate

does not explain the EWF results on slow cooled films

where the essential work of fracture was not observed to be

strongly dependent on the branch length. For the three series

of films investigated in this study, viz. the blown, quenched

and slow cooled, the latter had the slowest rate of

crystallization and hence the highest opportunity to form a

more thermodynamically desirable equilibrium structure.

Thus, if tie molecule formation is favored at longer branch

lengths that consequently result in larger values of strength,

then this effect (‘O’w‘H’O‘B’) should be more pro-

nounced in the EWF results on slow cooled in comparison to

blown and quenched films. However, this is not the case.

Therefore, it is difficult to envision the increased formation

of tie molecules with increasing short chain branch length.

We, however, postulate that during the process of

deformation at high rates (1 m/s), the length of the short

chain branch may play an important role when it is pulled

into and potentially through the chain folded lamellar

regions as they deform. A very simplified schematic of this

concept is shown in Fig. 17. The magnitude of the resistance

offered by a shorter branch length undergoing deformation

through the crystalline regions could be lower than that

experienced by a longer branch length. Furthermore, for

LLDPEs that have only a few mol% (!5 mol%) of the short

chain branch comonomer, it is possible that this effect would

be pronounced at higher rates of deformation. This is

because at lower rates (0.0004 m/s) of deformation the

polymer chains have a longer time scale to respond to the

deformation, and consequently the resistance offered by

the branch during deformation may be independent of its

length. However, while this explanation is a hypothesis that

might explain the observed phenomena, it is yet to be

confirmed. Future investigations need to be conducted to

gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of

deformation and their rate dependence at the molecular

level.

In the past, some attempts to investigate the slow crack

growth in polyethylenes have been conducted, [64–66]

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8835however, investigating the specific behavior of the SCB

during deformation especially at a higher rate is not trivial

as the choice of a suitable experiment that will allow such a

characterization is difficult. Another potential way to

investigate such behavior at high deformation rates might

be by the dynamic modeling of the deformation phenomena

that could trace a given SCB as it is pulled through the

crystalline regions during the deformation at higher rate.

Certainly, as such modeling codes become more predictive,

the approach may help to address the distinct differences

observed in our study.

5. Summary

Three LLDPE resins synthesized by a single site

metallocene catalyst using 1-butene, 1-hexene, and

1-octene as co-monomers were characterized to be

essentially identical in terms of their molecular weight

and distribution melt rheology, density, crystallinity, and

short chain branching content. The resins were also very

homogenous with respect to the short chain branch

distribution across their MWD, although very slight

differences were observed in the TREF profiles of the

three resins. Therefore, this sample set allows us to evaluate

the exclusive influence exerted by the short chain branch

length on the physical properties of the resulting films;

many previous attempts by other workers to accomplish

the same objective have been confounded by samples

that differed substantially in their chemical composition.

The physical properties of isotropic compression molded

(slow-cooled and quenched) films as well as blown films of

the subject LLDPEs were investigated using a variety of

tests carried out at widely differing deformation rates. The

blown films made from these resins had low levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and the flat plate WAXS

measurements indicated low a-axis orientation along the

MD (Keller–Machin low stress row structure). Within the

compression molded quenched and slow cooled series,

the lamellar and spherulitic scale lengths as determined by

SAXS and SALS indicated very similar dimensions

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. The blown and

compression molded films formed from these resins were

also found to be similar to each other (within a given series,

be it blown, quenched or slow cooled) in terms of

crystallinity, and overall crystallization characteristics,

although, slightly broader melting endotherms of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ were observed in the first melting

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films.

However, the tensile properties of slow cooled ‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min) were

very similar, thereby clearly indicating that these slight

differences in the TREF behavior and differences in first

melting DSC profiles of compression molded slow cooled

films really do not play any role in governing the final

mechanical properties of the LLDPE films obtained at

slower deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min).

At higher deformation rates (1 m/s), however, the

breaking strength was observed to increase with increasing

short chain branch length for all the samples investigated

(blown, quenched and slow cooled). This is consistent with

an earlier study [28] utilizing the same polymers and films










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378836investigated here, where the impact and tear strength of

blown films based on 1-octene and 1-hexene were found to

be considerably better than those of films based on 1-butene.

While the deformation rates in the above mentioned tests are

quite high, the rates change considerably during the

measurement. Therefore, the deformation characteristics

of the subject films were also studied in a well-defined and

controlled regime by analyzing the essential work of

fracture for the blown and compressed films. For the

blown films, the essential work of fracture was found to

increase systematically with increasing short chain branch

length. For the compression molded films, the 1-hexene and

1-octene based films performed better than the 1-butene

films. In general, the mechanical properties of 1-octene

based systems were somewhat enhanced relative to those

based on 1-hexene. However, this is not an all inclusive

statement, as the compression molded films of ‘O’

performed equally to ‘H’ in high speed tensile (breaking

strength at 1 m/s), puncture resistance and EWF tear tests.

From these results, it can be concluded that the length of the

short chain branch length plays a crucial role in determining

the mechanical properties of LLDPE, especially at high

deformation rates. It is hypothesized that the magnitude of

the resistance offered by a shorter branch length undergoing

deformation through the crystalline regions could be lower

than that offered by a longer branch length. However,

further studies to gain a better understanding of the

underlying physical process of deformation need to be

conducted.

ABSTRACT: Top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene (PE)
films exposed to corona discharge display large and opposite
electrostatic potentials, forming an electric bilayer in agree-
ment with recent and unexpected findings from Zhiqiang et al.
Water wetting, chemical composition and roughness of the
two surfaces are different. Surprisingly, the bottom surface,
opposite to the corona electrode is charged but it is not
oxidized, neither is it wetted with water. Moreover, its
morphology is unaltered by charging, while the hydrophilic
top surface is much rougher with protruding islands that are
the result of oxidation followed by phase separation and
polymer−polymer dewetting. Common liquids extract the oxidized, hydrophilic material formed at the upper surface, a result
that explains the well-known sensitivity of adhesive joints made using corona-treated thermoplastics to liquids, especially water.
These results show that poling the surface closer to the corona electrode triggers another but different charge build-up process at
the opposite surface. The outcome is another poled PE surface showing high potential but with unchanged chemical
composition, morphology and wetting behavior as the pristine surface, thus opening new possibilities for surface engineering.

1. INTRODUCTION
Corona discharge is widely used in industry to improve wetting
and adhesion characteristics of polymers for applications in
adhesive bonding and printing.1−3 The surface modification is
triggered by ions formed in the air when a sufficiently large
potential difference is applied between two asymmetric
electrodes (generally, a curved and a plate electrode), creating
a large electric field that accelerates ions toward the polymer
surface. The increased adhesion and wettability of polymers
subjected to this treatment is mainly related to the introduction
of polar groups due to oxidation and other concurrent chemical
and physical changes in the surface.4−9 In a conventional corona discharge device, the curved
electrode is biased and the plate electrode is grounded.10,11 However, other geometric arrangements have been used for
specific applications. For instance, the decomposition of phenol
in water was enhanced when a stainless steel cylinder, covered
with multiwalled carbon nanotubes, was used as the grounded
electrode in a wetted-wall corona-discharge reactor.12 An
inverted configuration, where the needle is the grounded
electrode and the plate electrode is biased, was used to increase
the removal efficiency of aerosol particles from the gas using a
grounded atomizing water discharge electrode.13 The use of inverted corona setup during polymer treatment
is interesting, since the needle can be safely filled with
grounded liquids, thus being a source of ions derived from the
liquid vapor. This type of experiment is difficult to control
when using a biased needle as in the conventional geometry,
because the reduction of surface tension of the biased liquid

exiting the needle forms elongated jets that break into
droplets.14,15 It is well-known that polymer surfaces subjected to corona
treatment acquire high electrostatic potential due to the
deposition of positive or negative ions16−18 that migrate
through the atmosphere driven by the electric field until they
bind to a surface. Positive discharge provides solvated protons
[(H2O)nH

+]19 as the most abundant species, while CO3−,
NO3−, NO2−, O3−, and O2− were identified by mass
spectrometry as the main reactants formed by negative
discharge.20 Upon hitting the polymer surface, ions can trigger
the formation of unstable free radicals and ionic species.
Recent papers from Chen’s group21−23 show, using the

pulsed electroacoustic technique (PEA), that the polyethylene
surface facing the plate electrode (bottom surface) also acquires
a significant amount of charge during corona treatment.
However, the sign of charge in the bottom surface is opposite
to the sign of charge deposited on the surface facing the curved
electrode (top surface), showing that a bipolar charge injection
takes place during the corona treatment. These recent results
show that the effect of corona discharge on PE is much more
complex than previously acknowledged.
Charge carriers responsible for the top surface charging in a

corona treatment are well established in the literature,19,20 but
the mechanism of recently disclosed bottom charging has not

yet been elucidated. This is due to the well-known difficulty of
identification of charge-bearing species in electrified insula-
tors.24−32 Chen23 proposed that the charge carriers responsible for the
polyethylene bottom surface charging subjected to corona
treatment are injected from the plate electrode, being electrons
from the cathode and holes from the anode, according to the
Schottky mechanism. This can now be reinterpreted consider-
ing recent results that identify ions derived from the sample
polymers as the charge carriers in contact and tribocharg-
ing.24−26,28,32 The aim of the present work is to gather information at the
macroscopic and microscopic levels to better understand
charging processes involved in corona treatment as well as
their effect on polyethylene surfaces. The present results show,
for the first time, that the macroscopic charge bilayers, formed
during the discharge, have surfaces with different roughness,
water wetting ability, and chemical composition. Besides,
extraction with solvents reveals that common liquids dissolve
some components of the oxidized surfaces, according to their
Hildebrand parameters, and the reason for the formation of the
rough upper surface is explained considering the immiscibility
between PE and the oxidized PE formed during the corona
treatment.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Chemicals. Samples were prepared by cutting 140-μm-thick

blown LDPE films into small pieces (10 mm × 10 mm). LDPE film
identity was verified by ATR infrared, as shown in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information. Prior to use, the polyethylene samples were
immersed for 10 min in ethanol within an ultrasonic bath and then
dried at room temperature.
Reagent-grade ethanol, acetone, butanol, chloroform, toluene, and

hexane were acquired from Synth (Saõ Paulo) and used as received.
Millipore water was used throughout.
In some experiments, the bottom side of PE films pieces was coated

with ca. 10 nm Au/Pd film using a MED 020 (Bal-Tec) instrument.
2.2. Inverted Corona Discharge Treatment. The inverted

corona treatment setup used for charging the samples is schematically
represented in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. In this
configuration, the needle is grounded and the plate electrode is biased.
Preliminary observations, using the applied voltage from 4 to 7 kV,

revealed that below ±5 kV no major changes in water wettability took
place, while beyond ±6 kV, a spark discharge was observed during the
experiment. Thus, positive (+5 kV and +6 kV) and negative (−5 kV
and −6 kV) tension was applied during 3 min to the plate electrode
using a Spellman CZE 1000R power supply, while the grounded
needle was kept filled with water. The distance between the electrodes
was fixed at 6 mm, providing an electric field greater than the
breakdown strength of the air.33 The temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and the
relative humidity (50 ± 2 %RH) were controlled during the
experiments.
2.3. Electrostatic Potential Measurement. Electrostatic poten-

tial maps were obtained for corona-treated polyethylene films. The
scanning apparatus was built by Optron (Campinas). The sample
holder was an aluminum plate where the polymer film was laid. The
potential probe is a 5-mm-diameter Kelvin electrode connected to a
Trek model 347 noncontact voltmeter. This electrode is mounted on a
mechanical arm that allows it to scan the x−y plane, under
microcomputer control. The entire ensemble is mounted within a
closed metal box, which enables control of the atmospheric
composition, especially the relative humidity. The spatial resolution
of the potential measurement (5 × 5 mm2) was limited by the Kelvin
electrode dimensions and the time allowed for the electrometer to
equilibrate on each pixel was 1 s.
2.4. Allignment of Charged PE Film within an Electric Field.

Corona-treated polyethylene was exposed to the electric field

generated between two vertical parallel-plate electrodes 40 mm
apart. Voltage in one plate changed from 0 to 2 kV or from 0 to −2kV, while the other one was grounded. The film sample was placed
equidistant from both electrodes, suspended by a thin cotton thread,
and it was observed while voltage was changed. A movie was recorded
using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.5. Electric Suspension. Horizontal parallel-plate electrodes
were mounted to verify polyethylene levitation. The charged PE
sample was placed in between the two electrodes, and voltage was
gradually changed in one electrode while the other was grounded. A
movie was recorded using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.6. Charge Excess Measurement and Charge Excess
Simulation. Pieces of polyethylene treated by inverted corona
discharge were inserted within a Faraday cup connected to the input
of a Keithley 610C electrometer and the charge excess was
immediately read. Charge was also evaluated from electrostatic
potential measurements applying the superposition principle to a
virtual charge distribution, using a previously described proce-
dure.29−31 The total electrostatic potential (VT) generated by all
surface charges at the plane 2 mm away from a charge-carrying surface
(r = 5 mm) is thus calculated using a C2+ code for eq 1: ∑ ∑

and ε is the dielectric constant of the medium.

A squared area (5 × 5 mm2) of the electrostatic map is represented
by a 200 × 200 pixel matrix. The virtual charge distribution on the
matrix is adjusted by trial and error, until the calculated and the
experimental electric potentials in every pixel have similar values.
Then, the surface charge excess values obtained for top and bottom
polyethylene surfaces were subtracted and compared to the measured
value.

2.7. Contact Angle Measurement. Contact angle of 5 μL water
droplets deposited on corona-treated polyethylene films were
measured by the Young−Laplace (sessile drop fitting) method using
a Krüss Easydrop DSA20 instrument.

2.8. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The surface composi-
tion of corona-treated polyethylene was analyzed by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha
instrument equipped with aluminum Kα line and a VG-CLAMP-2electron hemispherical analyzer, providing an energy resolution of
∼0.85 eV. The atomic composition of the samples was determined by
integrating the core-level peaks, properly weighted by the photo-
emission cross section.

2.9. Atomic Force Microscopy. Topography and phase contrast
images of the corona-treated polyethylene films were obtained in
noncontact mode using a Shimadzu SPM-9600 microscope with a
Nanoworld silicon tip (resonance frequency = 320 kHz and force
constant = 42 N/m). The scanning system is enclosed within an
environmental chamber under controlled temperature and relative
humidity.

2.10. Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy. Solids
extracted from the film surfaces were imaged using a Libra 120 Zeiss
transmission microscope, equipped with an Omega energy filter, that
allows the acquisition of EELS (electron energy loss spectra). A
droplet of solvent used to rinse the PE surface was directly deposited
in the carbon film over a TEM sample holder grid, then dried for 30min under air, and the sample was introduced in the microscope.
Bright-field images and EELS spectra were acquired.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Macroscopic Characterization. When the needle

electrode is either positive or negative relative to the plate
electrode, PE upper surface acquires electric potential with the
same sign as the needle electrode, even when this is grounded.
Averages from triplicate surface potential measurements are

presented in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. After

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901893 either +6 kV or −6 kV under the standard and inverted corona
geometries is applied, the absolute values of electrostatic
potential measured on the top surface layer are all similar
(ranging from ±1500 to 1600 V), but with opposite signs.
The polymer surface in contact with the plate electrode

(bottom surface) also displays significant electrostatic potential,
with signal opposite to that measured on the top surface
(Figure 1). As an example, after the needle electrode is

grounded and −6 kV is applied to the plate electrode (positive
inverted corona), the electrostatic potential acquired on the
upper film side is (+1602 ± 105) V, while on the bottom, it is
(−1145 ± 49) V. Thus, the polymer layer that is in contact
with the lower plate but not directly exposed to the corona also
acquires charge, forming a positive/negative charge bilayer that
in turn creates a field measuring ca. 20 kV mm−1 across the
polymer bulk.
Observation of the charged film within an electric field

provides visible evidence of its dipolar nature. Movies 1 and 2(avi format) show a film treated by positive inverted corona
between two electrodes. After a gradual negative voltage is
applied to one electrode and the other is grounded, the film
rotates until the positive surface faces the negative electrode
and then attaches to it, as shown in movie 1. Vice versa, when
the applied voltage was set as positive (movie 2), the film
rotates so as to attach the negative surface to the positive
electrode.

To verify how the charging process works in a multilayer,
three superimposed 140 μm polyethylene films (arranged as a
sandwich) were stacked on top of the horizontal plate
electrode, and this was biased to +6 kV in the inverted corona
arrangement. Figure 2a shows the electrostatic potential

measured on each film surface. The piece that was laid in
contact with the plate electrode during the treatment (lower
film) presents positive electric potential on both surfaces, while
the upper film acquires negative potential on both surfaces.
Both sides of the middle film are charged, but one is negative
and the other is positive. Furthermore, the absolute values of
the electrostatic potential are lower than those measured for
only one film, suggesting that the charge carriers deposited on
PE during the poling process are diluted through the polymer
sandwich. This also shows that charge builds up in a film that is
isolated both from the lower electrode and from the ionized
atmosphere adjacent to the needle electrode.
Electrostatic charge excess of the polymer sandwich was also

measured, using the Faraday cup. The results shown in Figure
2b are in agreement with electric potential measurements. The
lower film has positive charge excess, while the upper film is
negative and the film that was placed in the middle of each
sandwich presents charge excess close to zero.
In other experiment, the bottom surface of polyethylene film

samples was metal-coated with Au/Pd prior to charging.
Potential on the top side of films treated by grounding the
needle and applying −6 kV to the plate electrode (inverted
positive corona) is (+1699 ± 99) V, the same as in the
uncoated samples. Nevertheless, the electrostatic potential
measured on the bottom surface is close to zero, revealing that
opposite charges are not retained on it (see Figure 3).

polyethylene films exposed to the needle electrode (top side) and to
the plate electrode (bottom side): (a) standard and (b) inverted
corona arrangements. Voltage applied to needle/plate electrodes is

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901894 Corona-charged samples with the conductive layer on one
side levitate within a vertical electric field of ca. −200 kV/m, as
shown in Movie 3 (availabe in avi format). Non-metal-coated
samples do not levitate, even when a much higher voltage is
applied to the top electrode, probably due to the lower net
charge in the bilayer charged film.
Surface potential decay as a function of time under constant

relative humidity (70% RH) was measured for polyethylene
films treated using positive (−5 kV) and negative (+5 kV)
inverted corona. Sample scanning started immediately after
each sample was charged. Figure 4a shows the potential decay
curves from top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene treated by
−5 kV inverted corona. Both curves level off at the negative
equilibrium potential (ca. −5 V) that was recently discovered in
this research group.34 From each plot, the time required to
halve the initial potential (see Figure 4b) is obtained and
defined as the potential half-life.
Polyethylene pieces treated by positive corona present

significant difference between the half-lives measured on top
and on bottom surfaces: the half-life of the negative potential
on the bottom layer is three times longer than for the positive
potential on top surface. On the other hand, when the
polyethylene films are treated by negative corona discharge, the
half-lives measured on top (negative) and bottom (positive)
surfaces are quite similar. Altogether, these results show that
different charge-bearing species contribute to surface charging.
To determine if the charging processes alter the polyethylene

surface free energy, contact angles for water with top and
bottom surface layers were acquired as soon as the samples
were charged, and the results are shown in Table 1. Top
surfaces exposed to inverted corona discharge show contact
angle 40° lower than the untreated samples, but the bottom
surfaces are unchanged. Contact angles were followed for 60days after film charging to evaluate surface aging under air.
After 50 days aging at 60% RH, the contact angle measured on
the top surface reverted to the original values of untreated film.
A remarkable feature observed in corona-treated poly-

ethylene is that immersion in ethanol, butanol, acetone,
toluene, and chloroform easily removes top and bottom surface
charges. Films treated by positive inverted corona (−5 kV)
were immersed for 20 min in these liquids, laid on an aluminum
plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The electrostatic
potentials measured for both rinsed surfaces are in the same
range as those obtained for untreated polyethylene films,

indicating that charge suppression or extraction was fairly
complete. On the other hand, water and hexane are not good
solvents for the charge carriers, since the PE surfaces still show
a significant residual electrostatic potential after rinsing with
these two liquids (see Figure 5a).
Contact angle of polyethylene top surface is almost restored

to initial value after the charged films are rinsed with butanol,
acetone, toluene, and chloroform, as shown in Figure 5b.
Nevertheless, when the rinsing solvents are ethanol, hexane,
and water, contact angles still remain significantly lower than
the those of untreated film, showing that these liquids cannot
fully extract the oxidized surface components.
In a set of experiments, polyethylene films were corona-

charged and rinsed with ethanol, and after that, the same film
was charged again. The charging/rinsing process was repeated
five times. Electrostatic potential on PE surface reveals that
charges are removed after each ethanol rinsing, but the film

treated again.
3.2. XPS and Microscopy. XPS spectra of top and bottom

polyethylene surfaces treated by inverted corona discharge (+5kV) were obtained and then compared to the untreated sample.
Carbon and oxygen elements are present in all samples, but
after corona treatment, the oxygen content on top surface
increases from 3% to 14%, while on the bottom surface, it is
unchanged.
Atomic force microscopy was used to observe surface

morphology on top and bottom polyethylene surfaces treated
by inverted corona discharge. Topography and phase contrast
images from different areas of both sides were simultaneously
acquired, and some representative micrographs are displayed in
Figures 6 and 7. Darker regions in phase contrast images
represent more rigid domains that are less able to dissipate
mechanical energy than the brighter areas.
Both sides of untreated polyethylene (Figures 6a,b and 7a,b)

are similar. Topography is fairly smooth with maximum height
ranging from 130 to 200 nm. Moreover, the corresponding
phase images present low contrast, showing that the untreated
polymer surface is chemically homogeneous (or, at least,
viscoelastically homogeneous). Following corona treatment, the
top surface layer is modified, as shown in Figure 6c−f: taller

rigid particles or granules protrude out of the substrate,
producing higher phase contrast.
Besides, the AFM micrographs reveal that grainy pattern

formation depends on corona discharge polarity. Under −5 kV
(Figure 6c,d), small rigid granules with 10−100 nm height are
produced. However, when the plate electrode voltage is positive
(Figure 6e,f), the surface is more extensively covered by rigid
particles (height from 10 to 65 nm).
Although the corona treatment causes morphological

changes in the top side of the polymer film, no significant
variation is observed in the bottom surface layer. Images from
the bottom side, obtained after positive (Figure 7c,d) and
negative (Figure 7e,f) inverted corona treatment, do not show
the granules observed in the upper surface, nor other new
morphology features.
Another important aspect shown by AFM images is that,

after ethanol rinsing of the sample shown in Figure 6e,f, most
granular rigid material formed during corona treatment is
removed (Figure 8), leaving the surface more even and soft.
Nevertheless, the morphology of the original surface is not fully
recovered.
The extracted material from the top surface of the corona-

treated polyethylene was analyzed by electron spectroscopy
imaging in the transmission electron microscopy (ESI-TEM). A
small volume (5 μL) of ethanol used to rinse the polymer
surface was deposited on TEM sample holder, and the solvent
was then allowed to dry at room temperature. Bright-field
images (Figure 9) reveal the presence of noncontinuous film
along the substrate as well as of dendritic material (see Figure
9c) formed by dewetting. Energy-loss spectra (Figure 9d)
present only two predominant peaks: one very intense at ca.
283 eV and a low intensity peak at ca. 540 eV. These peaks are
characteristic from carbon and oxygen, respectively, and they
confirm that the extracted material is oxidized.

4. DISCUSSION
Polyethylene films treated by inverted corona discharge acquire
large but opposite electrostatic potential on top and bottom
surfaces, thus forming a charge bilayer that can also be
described as a macroscopic dipole across the polymer film (see
Figure 1). Even though corona treatment has been used for
decades, the bilayer nature of the film was observed only
recently for the first time, and the involved mechanisms are not
yet understood, but the present results allow us to present a
model for charge bilayer formation.

Dipole Formation and Oxidation. Chemical and wetting
properties of the two surfaces are different; thus, the two poling
processes responsible for the surface charging are independent
and they can be separated, as verified in the sandwich
experiment (Figure 2). Moreover, the adsorbed bottom charges
are suppressed by a conducting layer previously evaporated on
the surface, leading to the formation of a charge monolayer that
levitates in an electric field.
In the present case, the bottom surface charging process

takes place within the space charge threshold established by
Montanari et al.35,36 According to these authors, LDPE poled
within a Laplacian field only acquires charge when the field is
higher than 10 kV/mm. The electric field experienced by the
sample due to the deposited charge on the upper surface is
about 20 kV/mm, above the threshold value.
The characterization of the charge carriers adopted by

Montanari et al.36 was done by evaluating the decay rate of
positive and negative charges injected into polyethylene

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901896 surfaces. When both depletion curves have the same profiles,
the charge carriers are of the same type (electrons and holes).
However, when the curves have different profiles, there are two
families of carriers (positive and negative ions or ions and
electrons/holes). Since the electrostatic potential half-lives of
bottom surfaces exposed to negative and positive corona
discharges are very different (Figure 4b), and electro-
luminescence experiments show that the electron/hole
injection in polyethylene films occurs only at very high electric
fields,37,38 we propose that the bottom charges are from two
families of carriers. Following Montanari criteria, they are
positive ions in negative corona treatment and negative ions in
positive corona treatment.
Surface charge excess that accounts for the measured

potentials in a positive discharge (see section 2.6) are +4.9 ×
10−10 C/cm2 and −3.5 × 10−10 C/cm2 for top and bottom
surfaces, respectively; thus, the excess value for the entire piece
is +1.4 × 10−10 C/cm2, lower but in the same order of
magnitude as the value obtained by direct charge measurement

(+3.8 × 10−10 C/cm2). Assuming that the charge carriers are
ions, we can estimate a concentration of only ca. 30 ions per
μm2. Even this low charge carrier concentration leads to high
electrostatic potentials, in excess of 1000 V on each surface.
The pronounced difference between the chemical composi-

tion, roughness, and wetting behavior of the two film surfaces
show that charge carriers at the bottom surface do not derive
from oxidized polymer. We suggest that they are formed by
adsorption of negative or positive water molecule cluster ions
from the atmosphere, due to the large potential gradient
created by the ions initially deposited on the surface exposed to
corona. The hypothesis of participation of atmospheric water in
insulator charging phenomena has already been extensively
verified in polymers and other materials, in many different
experimental situations,14,29−32 and the “sandwich” experiment
(Figure 2) provides another clear verification for it, since the
charge on the polymer at the interior of the three-sheet pile
cannot be assigned to implantation of corona ions or to
electron/hole injection from the plate electrode.

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901898 surface potentials measured with Kelvin electrodes. Prior to this
work, Xiao39 observed that the effect of different solvents on
the wetting behavior of corona-treated PE depends on the
solvent used. The present results show that this can be assigned
to the extraction of charged and oxidized polymer fragments.
Toluene, acetone, n-butanol, and chloroform are all more

effective than either water or n-hexane. By plotting the ion
efficiency removal as a function of Hildebrand’s parameter40 for
these liquids, a bell-shaped curve is obtained (Figure S4 of the
Supporting Information), as usual in phenomena dependent on
mutual miscibility between a polymer and a solvent. Using this
plot, we can estimate that the Hildebrand parameter for the
surface species is in the 18−23.5 MPa1/2 range. This broad
range is probably due to the complex nature of the extracted
material that is a mixture of oxidized oligo- and macroions.
Ethanol has a peculiar behavior: it effectively extracts the

charged species from PE surface but without increasing water
contact angle back to the original value. This shows that at least

part of the oxidized species formed on the polymer surface by
corona discharge are not ions.
In addition to the solubility parameter, solvent-rinsing

experiments revealed that the polar material extracted is only
found in the outermost surface layer, since all of the charge can
be removed without detectable change in film thickness, with a
1 μm resolution. Thus, a significant part of material produced
by corona treatment is only loosely anchored in the polymer
surface.

Modified Surface Morphology. Corona charging has a
pronounced effect on the morphology of the film surface
directly exposed to corona but not on the opposite surface that
is in contact with the flat electrode. Treated top surfaces show
many granules that are mechanically stiffer than the
surrounding polymer. The granular pattern on corona-treated
polyethylene and other polyolefin was previously reported in
the literature,41−43 and its formation depends on the exposure
time, temperature, and gas composition used during the
treatment.

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901899 Kim et al.41 suggested that granule formation is caused by the
degradation of the polyethylene molecules below an inert skin,
since the gas evolved during the degradation process may cause
the topmost skin to blister. Nevertheless, Overney et al.42 explained the occurrence of droplets considering the local
surface melting of degraded products formed during corona
treatment.
According to our results, both the size of the rigid granules

(Figure S5 of the Supporting Information) and the film charge
decrease with time, suggesting that the granules contain
charged species, thus explaining the low dissipative response
of the tip while scanning the granules. This behavior is
analogous to polyelectrolyte chains in solution under low ionic
strength, which are stiffer than neutral chains.44,45 Overney et
al.42 also verified by frictional force microscopy that these
granules are more rigid, but they did not associate their stiffness
to the presence of charge.
All these observations can be understood considering that

corona discharge under air chemically modifies adjacent PE
surfaces, oxidizing them and forming a modified polymer that is
expected to be immiscible with PE, since immiscibility is the
rule among polymers. For this reason, the pristine and modified
polymer tends to phase-separate. Beyond, since the surface
tension of the oxidized polymer is necessarily higher than PE
surface tension, the oxidized surface film cannot wet bare PE
and thus it retracts or dewets,46 forming the charged granules
that are extracted with some solvents. The mechanisms
involved in the positive inverted corona discharge treatment
are schematically represented in Figure 10. 5. CONCLUSION

Corona treatment of polyethylene film produces a host of
complex modifications not only in the surface directly exposed
to corona, but also in the opposite surface. The only feature
common to both surfaces is the large (but opposite)
electrostatic potential that transforms the film into a charged
bilayer. Otherwise, the chemical composition, wetting behavior,
morphology, and response to solvents of the two film surfaces
are completely different, pointing toward two different poling
mechanisms: deposition of corona atmospheric ions on one
surface followed by adsorption of oppositely charged water
molecule clusters on the opposite surface, under the field
created by the corona ions and other ions deriving from these.
The roughness on the polymer surface exposed to corona is
due to polymer−polymer immiscibility: oxidized and charged
PE dewets the unaltered polymer due to its high surface tension
forming domains stiffened by excess charge.

Received in final form 21 June 2004 Abstract—Oxygen plasma-treated quenched and annealed polypropylene (PP) films with different
crystallinities were investigated to characterize the surface rearrangement behavior during aging using
contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Optimum plasma conditions were
examined by varying the power, time and pressure. Less crystalline quenched PP showed a larger
increase in water contact angle and a larger decrease of oxygen atomic concentration during aging
than the more crystalline annealed PP, since the oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups, introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment, oriented towards or diffused faster into the bulk with lower crystallinity.
The degree of crosslinking on the surface was enhanced after plasma treatment and, in addition to
increased crystallinity, the crosslinked structure induced by plasma treatment restricted chain mobility
and lowered the aging rate of the PP surface.

Keywords: Plasma treatment; aging; surface rearrangement.

1. INTRODUCTION

Although polypropylene (PP) possesses good mechanical and chemical properties,
its use has been restricted in various applications owing to its low surface energy.
The interest in plasma modification of polymer surfaces has gradually increased in
the plastics industry for the last 30 years, since it can improve, e.g. the wettability,
adhesion, biocompatibility and printability [1–5]. Moreover, plasma treatment can
be carried out within only a few nanometers of the surface without altering the bulk
properties of the polymer.

Although the plasma treatment of polymers has become a mature technology,
research aimed at understanding the aging behavior of treated surfaces with time
of storage is still continuing. Enhanced hydrophilicity of the PP surface can
be obtained from hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl, which can be
introduced by oxygen plasma treatment. However, a commonly observed and
troublesome phenomenon is the deterioration of the beneficial surface properties
(hydrophilicity) with aging. Such an effect is easily manifested in contact-angle
measurements where one observes an increase in contact angle on long-term
storage. It has been suggested that this hydrophobic recovery is mainly due to two
processes [2, 5–7]: reorientation of polar chemical groups towards the bulk of the
material to reduce the surface energy, and the other is the diffusion of polar chemical
groups in the polymer matrix.

This aging behavior is usually strongly affected by environmental conditions.
High temperature helps the polymer chain to move freely and accelerate the surface
rearrangement. On the other hand, in a high humidity, the water molecules are
adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface and these water molecules disturb the rotation
or diffusion of polar groups [1, 2, 6].

The surface rearrangement due to reorientation and diffusion at the surface can
be reduced by limiting the mobility of polymer chains. The chain mobility mainly
occurs in an amorphous region and the mobility in a crystalline region is fairly
limited because of an orderly packed structure [8–11]. With highly crystalline
polymers, hydrophobic recovery would be reduced because the highly restricted
chain mobility in the crystalline region would hinder the rotational and translational
motions in the surface region after plasma treatment. Thus the restricted chain
mobility decreases the aging rate of the hydrophilic surface with a crystalline
polymer.

The surface changes after plasma treatment were investigated using X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact-angle measurements. The effect of
crystallinity on aging was studied with quenched and annealed PP. The degree of
crosslinking was examined after plasma treatment by measuring the gel content and
the effect of crosslink density on aging was also investigated.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.1. Materials

Isotactic polypropylene (PP, Mw 250 000) was supplied in the form of pellets by
Daehan Yuwha (Ulsan, South Korea). These pellets were pressed and formed into
thin sheets (0.5 mm) on stainless steel plates at 220◦C for 10 min with a mould
force of 50 kN. The molded sheets were then cleaned thoroughly in an ultrasonicator
using a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture for 20 min, dried using compressed air and stored
in a vacuum desiccator with 20% RH at room temperature.

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1281 2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Determination of crystallinity. The crystallization process was conducted
after molding the PP samples. To prepare low-crystallinity PP, molten PP films im-
mediately after molding were quenched into liquid nitrogen to reduce crystalliza-
tion of the polymer. Thermal treatment for a long time (24 h) at high temperature
(145◦C) was carried out to increase the degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity
of the above two PP samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) according to the standard procedure mentioned in the literature [12]. The
empirical heat of fusion for 100% crystalline PP was set at 187 J/g [13]. The crys-
tallinity was also obtained by wide-angle X-ray scattering spectra from X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD). As the crystallinity determined from DSC or XRD does not repre-
sent surface crystallinity, so surface crystallinity was determined using the grazing
incident angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) at 8C1 beamline of PAL (Pohang Accelera-
tion Laboratory). An incident angle of 0.1◦ was selected for GIXD and the depth of
penetration (τ ) at 0.1◦ grazing angle was calculated to be 100 nm from the following
equation [14]:

τ = sin2 θ − sin2 ψ

2µ sin θ cos ψ
(α = θ + ψ), (1) where α is the angle of incidence, θ is one-half the scattering angle, ψ is the tilt
angle and µ is the linear absorption coefficient. The crystallinities of quenched and
annealed PP obtained from DSC, XRD and GIXD are shown in Table 1. 2.2.2. Plasma treatment of PP samples. Cleaned PP samples were treated
with oxygen plasma using a home-made capacitively-coupled plasma generator
operating at 13.56 MHz. To obtain the optimum conditions (power, time and
pressure), plasma-generating conditions were varied and the following optimum
conditions were selected from the results of water contact-angle measurements:
power, pressure and treatment time of 110 W, 3.33 Pa (2.5 × 10−2 Torr) and
60 s, respectively. Following the plasma treatment, the samples were washed
ultrasonically in a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture to remove the low-molecular-weight

materials generated from chain scission and then dried. For the aging studies, the
samples were stored in desiccators for 30 days.

2.2.3. Contact-angle measurements. Contact-angle measurements on the
plasma-treated samples were performed at ambient temperature by the sessile drop
method with a contact-angle goniometer (CA-A, Kyowa Surface Science, Japan).
The equilibrium contact angle of water on untreated PP was found to be 100◦. An
average of at least six readings was reported in each case. The error limit in the
measurement of contact angle was around ±0.5◦. The contact angle of n-octane
in water was measured using the transparent glass cell and doubly bent needle as
shown in Fig. 1 to investigate the change in PP surfaces in the water environment.

2.2.4. XPS analysis. The chemical surface atomic composition of plasma-treated
polymer samples was investigated by XPS. The measurements were performed with
a Perkin-Elmer PHI-5400 Photoelectron Spectrometer using Mg Kα X-ray source
(1253.6 eV, 350 W). The C1s and O1s spectra of the samples were recorded with
0.2 eV interval energy. The C1s spectra of the untreated and oxygen plasma-treated
quenched PP are shown in Fig. 2. The operating pressure during analysis was in the
range of 10−9 Torr. Angle-resolved XPS measurements were carried out at take-off
angles of 20◦ (3.4 nm depth) and 90◦ (10 nm depth) for depth profiling of the treated
surfaces both before and after aging, and sampling depth for each take-off angle was
calculated from equation (2) [1, 16, 17]:

ζ = 3λ sin θ, (2) where ζ is the sampling depth, λ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) and θ is the
take-off angle. The mean free path of photoelectrons emitted from the samples was
calculated using equation (3):

λ = 0.11ρ−1E0.5k , (3) D

where ρ is the density of polymer (PP = 0.9 g/cm3) and Ek is the kinetic energy
of photoelectron. Initial XPS analysis was carried out 2 h after plasma treatment
because it took 2 h to stabilize the pressure (below 10−9 Torr) in the main chamber.
C1s and O1s spectra were obtained after 1, 2, 13 and 30 days to observe the decay of
oxygen containing species on the surface. Atomic concentration of oxygen (Coxygen)
was calculated from respective peak areas of assumed Gaussian–Lorentzian curves
using the following equation:

The carbon (Acarbon) and oxygen (Aoxygen) areas were calculated using the PC
software, ‘PeakFit’, and the atomic sensitivity factors (S) based on peak area
measurement were taken as 0.296 for C1s and 0.711 for O1s to normalize the
intensities of the signals [18].

2.2.5. Measurement of gel content. Gel content was measured before and after
oxygen plasma treatment. PP films trapped in the mesh basket made of stainless
steel wire were dissolved in hot naphthalene (170◦C) for 12 h according to ASTM
D 2765. The residual weight of PP in the mesh was measured, and since this
residue was mainly from the crosslinked structures, the degree of crosslinking was
determined from the gel content.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Plasma process conditions

Power, time and pressure are important factors which affect the hydrophilicity of
polymer samples, because the density and the energy of ions impinging on the
sample surface depend on these parameters [19–21]. Figure 3 shows the water
contact angles on oxygen plasma-treated PP under various treatment powers and
times at 3.33 Pa. To obtain the lowest water contact angle, meaning the highest

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1285 hydrophilicity of surface, a longer time or high power was required. As the
treatment time decreased, more power was needed to obtain a water contact angle
under 10 degrees. Low power cannot generate high density of ions with an energy
higher than the bond energy of C H to generate radicals on the PP surface and,
thus, longer treatment time can increase the number of radicals.

The effect of pressure on the oxygen plasma treatment of PP is shown in the
Fig. 4 with 100 W for 2 min. The water contact angle decreased as the pressure
dropped and the lowest water contact angle was observed at 3.33 Pa. At lower
chamber pressures, the mean free paths of the ions and electrons are longer, and
the ions can strike the surface with a relatively low loss of kinetic energy. At
high pressure, however, the intensity of collisions between the ions and the neutral
molecules increases, with the particles losing kinetic energy before colliding with
the surface, resulting in low generation of radicals [21]. Below the pressure of
3.33 Pa, the water contact angle increased, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. At too
low pressure, the number of particles (neutral molecules) is low and the generation
of ions is little, since ions are generated from the collision of electrons with neutral
molecules. Even if the ions strike the surface of the polymer without loss of kinetic
energy, the number of collisions between the ions and the surface is not high and
there are not enough radicals formed on the surfaces.

From the above experiment, 3.33 Pa pressure, 1 min time and 110 W Rf power
were chosen as optimum process conditions and all oxygen plasma treatments were
carried out under these conditions.

3.2. XPS results

The surfaces of the oxygen plasma treated PP samples were characterized with XPS
(Fig. 5). Before aging, the oxygen concentration of the surface with 20◦ take-off
angle (approx. 3.4 nm depth) was 10% more than that of the surface with 90◦ take-
off angle (approx. 10 nm). The decrease of oxygen concentration with increasing
depth from the surface reveals that reactions of polymer chains with oxygen plasma
occurred in a very shallow surface region. For the generation of oxygen species,
carbon radicals had to be formed by the accelerated oxygen ions in the plasma and
reaction with the molecular oxygen. Since the oxygen ions could not penetrate
into the deep surface region and the molecular oxygen could not diffuse into the
bulk layer easily, the oxygen concentration of the oxygen plasma-treated PP surface
decreased with increasing take-off angle.

Annealed PP, having higher crystalline fraction, had lower concentration of
atomic oxygen than quenched PP having lower crystalline fraction. The higher
degree of oxygenation of the low crystalline sample indicates a greater chemical
reactivity of the sample with plasma. It appeared that the reaction intermediates

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1287 (mainly the radicals) were relatively more mobile in the polymer matrix having
lower crystalline fraction and, hence, are expected to react more easily with the
oxygen ions in the plasma [22]. Morra et al. have reported the influence of
crystallinity on the plasma modification of the polymer surface [5]. They concluded
that higher reactivity of the polymer, having lower crystalline fraction, was due to
greater freedom of motion granted by higher percentage of amorphous domains of
the polymer.

During aging, both quenched and annealed PP samples showed similar decrease
of oxygen concentration and the change was not much in the sampling depth of
10 nm (90◦ take-off angle). After 30 days of aging there was 8% decrease in oxygen
concentration with quenched PP, but only 4% decrease with annealed PP in the
sampling depth of 3.4 nm (20◦ take-off angle). This represents, that in the surface
depth around 3.4 nm, the migration of polar functional groups of the annealed PP
is much reduced due to higher crystallinity. Increase in crystallinity hinders the
movement of the polymer chains and, therefore, slows down the aging process due
to higher structural regularity and lower free volume in the polymer matrix [8, 23].

3.3. Contact angle variation with aging

As shown in Fig. 6, an increase of water contact angle on oxygen plasma-treated PP
was observed during aging in air. The modified hydrophilic polymer surface after
oxygen plasma treatment became hydrophobic again to reduce the interfacial free

energy between the surface and its environment. Hydrophilic groups introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment oriented towards or diffused into the bulk, and the
surface became hydrophobic. In the water condition, however, the surface of oxygen
plasma-treated PP was stable, since the difference in interfacial energy was not
high. Before oxygen plasma treatment, because PP was originally hydrophobic,
the contact angle of n-octane having similar surface energy as PP was low. But the
contact angle of n-octane was high after plasma treatment and it stayed constant
during aging in the water condition. In water, the hydrophilic groups formed by
plasma treatment did not reorient towards or diffuse into the bulk. The slight
decrease of contact angle of n-octane after 1 day aging was due to dissolution of
low-molecular-weight materials (LMWM) formed by plasma treatment. The loss
of LMWM having hydrophilic groups on the surface decreased the surface energy
of PP and hence the contact angle of n-octane.

From water contact angle measurements the amount of polar groups formed can
be estimated in the surface region (depth 0.5 nm) after plasma treatment [24, 25].
Although the contact angles on quenched and annealed PP were almost the same
(10◦) just after plasma treatment, there was more increase with less crystalline,
quenched PP during aging, as shown in Fig. 7. The increase was smaller for the
more crystalline, annealed PP and the retention of hydrophilicity was also relatively
high. The increase of contact angles after aging was interpreted as a result of
migration of polar groups away from the surface to the bulk (depth 0.5 nm). The

sharp increase of contact angle within 24 h was similar to the sharp decay of atomic
oxygen concentration determined from XPS in the depth of 3 nm.

The fraction of immobile polar groups (fim) was calculated using the equation
suggested by Hyun, and the fim values are shown in Table 2 [11]. Chatelier
et al. have defined ‘immobile’ polar groups as those that cannot participate in
polymer chain motions transporting the polar groups beyond the range of interfacial
potentials [24]. The polymer surface with a higher fim persisted to have a low
contact angle after long periods of aging due to the restricted polymer chain
movement in the well-ordered crystalline region. From the fim value of oxygen
plasma-treated PP, it was observed that the amount of immobile polar groups
(fim) of annealed PP was higher than those of quenched PP due to higher surface
crystallinity. These immobile polar groups with limited movement caused a low
rate of decay of oxygen containing species with more crystalline PP in the XPS
experiment. The decrease of hydrophobic recovery with the increase of crystallinity
is due to the restriction imposed on the loss of polar surface groups by the ordered
crystalline environment.

3.4. Crosslinking after plasma treatment

In spite of the difference in crystallinity more than 10% between annealed and
quenched PP, the more crystalline PP had only 5◦ lower water contact angle and
2% higher oxygen atomic concentration after 30 days aging. Also the fraction of
the immobile polar groups of more crystalline PP was not much more than that of
less crystalline PP. If the crystallinity was the only factor affecting the mobility
of polymer chains, the differences in water contact angle and oxygen atomic
concentration between quenched and annealed PP after aging would be much larger.
Therefore, we measured the gel content change after oxygen plasma treatment
(Table 3), and observed that the degree of crosslinking of less crystalline PP was
higher than that of more crystalline PP. Usually the formation of a three-dimensional
network is a well-known consequence of a polymer by inert gas plasma treatment,
and the reaction mechanisms were illustrated by Poncin-Epaillard and co-workers as
shown in Fig. 8 [27, 28]. The combination of radicals obtained after elimination of
CH3 could form the crosslinked structure. A higher degree of crosslinking formed in

low crystallinity PP limited the mobility of chains and, thus, reduced the difference
in surface rearrangements between low and high crystallinity PP.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The surface rearrangement of polypropylene (PP) having different crystallnities was
studied after oxygen plasma treatment using XPS and contact-angle measurements.
Less crystalline PP had a higher susceptibility to attack by plasma and had a higher
oxygen concentration on the surface because of the more amorphous fraction on
its surface. But during aging, the more crystalline PP had lower water contact
angle and higher oxygen concentration than the less crystalline PP. The mobility
of polar groups was reduced with increase of degree of crystallinity. After oxygen
plasma treatment, an enhancement of crosslinking was observed and the crosslinked
structure on the surface limited the reorientation and diffusion of polar functional
groups into the bulk.

The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the “heterogeneity” in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.   

1. Introduction 

Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1–5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, e.g., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, etc. [6–11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12–15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called ‘percolation threshold’ [16–18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19–21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22–24]. 

The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25–27]. 
Luo et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28–32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (λ⊥) of 5.5 W/m⋅K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
but a high λ⊥ of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (e.g., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ//) and a limited λ⊥ [33–35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the λ⊥ of the composites [36]. 

For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37–40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 

date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical “probe” detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials and sample preparation 

Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 μm and a thickness of 
~0.26 μm (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 μm is purchased from Ya’an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 ◦C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 ◦C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 ◦C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 

2.2. Characterizations 

The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 ◦C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 ◦C to 650 ◦C in a N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 ◦C 
with 10 ◦C/min from 30 ◦C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate 
thermal history. Then, the samples were cooled to 30 ◦C at a heating rate 
of 10 ◦C/min, followed by heating again to 220 ◦C.

The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 ◦C oven for 4 h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-Kα ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 Å. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5–50 o. 

3. Results 

To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ⊥), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 

The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 ◦C. Fig. 2a–d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, i.e., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The λ⊥
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both λ⊥ at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent λ⊥ (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m⋅K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m⋅K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 

As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (Tm) and crystallinity (Xc) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: Tm = 166.4 ◦C, Xc = 29.6%; the distal end: Tm = 166.9 ◦C, Xc =

28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 

To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of λ⊥ and the 

heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5◦ is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 

To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in λ⊥ and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, L1/L2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of L1/L2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of L1/L2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

Notably, the value of L1/L2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 

flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and λ⊥) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 

In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a–d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the λ⊥ of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the “dilution” 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of λ⊥ between the proximal and distal position (Δλ⊥/λ⊥) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The Δλ⊥/λ⊥ values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will “disturb” 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites. 

4. Discussion 

In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44–48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a “cold” 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 

During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly “freezes” when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 

During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

platelets within PP/FG composites.

FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 

The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm–8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(e.g., injection pressure, mold temperature, etc.) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future. 

5. Conclusion 

In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.

Decreased Thermal Conductivity
of Polyethylene Chain Influenced
by Short Chain Branching
In this paper, we have studied the effect of short branches (side chains) on the thermal
conductivity (TC) of a polyethylene (PE) chain. With a reverse nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics (RNEMD) method, TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are
simulated and compared. It shows that the branch has a positive effect to decrease the
TC of a PE chain. The TC of the PE-ethyl chain decreases with the number density
increase of branches, until the density becomes larger than about eight ethyl per 200 seg-
ments, where the TC saturates to be only about 40% that of a pristine PE chain. Because
of different weights, different branches will cause a different decrease of TCs, and a
heavy branch will lead to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

1 Introduction

Not only a high thermal conductivity (TC) but also a quite low
TC is desired for polymers because of their wide applications
[1–6], such as a high TC for application as a thermal interface
material [7,8] and a low TC for application as a thermal insulation
material. Single polymer chains and highly aligned polymer fibers
have attracted a wide attention due to their potential high TC
[9–16]. Although a single polymer chain may possess a high TC,
polymers are generally regarded as a thermal insulator because of
their very low thermal conductivities on the order of 0.1 W m1 K1 [17]. One of the reasons for the low TC is that the polymer
chains are randomly coiled in the polymers, which effectively
shortens the mean free path (MFP) of heat-carrying phonons
[18,19]. Another reason is that the TC of these polymers can be
significantly influenced by the morphology of individual chains
[14–17,20–22]. Besides these two reasons, the method to further
decrease the TC of a polymer is still desired to develop a thermal
insulator.

There have already been some methods to reduce the TC of a
polymer chain. Liao et al. [23] tuned the TC of a polymer chain
by atomic mass modifications and found that heavy substituents
hinder heat transport substantially. Robbins and Minnich [16]found that even perfectly crystalline polynorbornene has an
exceptionally low TC near the amorphous limit due to extremely
strong anharmonic scattering. Most recently, Ma and Tian [24]studied the influence of the side chains on the TC of bottlebrush
polymers, and predicted that side chains dominate the heat con-
duction and could lead to a lower TC. Some other studies also
shown that chain segment disorder, or the random rotations of
segments in a chain, will lead to a lower TC [15,25–28].

In this paper, we take the effect of branches into account to
probe a way to reduce the TC of a polymer. Considering the com-
plex structure of a polymer, we just focus on the polyethylene
(PE) chain. Results turn out that the TC of a PE chain with
branches can be decreased to be only 40% that of a pristine chain.
The paper is organized as follows: first, a reverse nonequilibrium

molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method is introduced; and then
the effects of backbone chain length, branching chain location,
branching chain type, and the number density of branching chains
are simulated and discussed. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

2 Simulation Method

The materials studio is applied to build the initial configuration
of the PE chain and the modified PE chain. The PE chain is estab-
lished by replicating the PE segments which is the unit cell of
PE’s idealized bulk lattice structure with a length of 2.507 Å. The
schematic structures of a pristine PE chain and a PE-ethyl chain
are shown in Fig. 1. After building the PE chain, with the COM-
PASS II potential [29–32], we first relax the system in an NVT
(constant number of atoms, temperature, and volume) ensemble at
a temperature of 300 K for 125 ps, where the Nose–Hoover ther-
mostat [33,34] is applied to obtain the constant temperature. And
then, a NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy)
ensemble is used to release the thermal stress. In the simulation
process, we double-check that the total energy has reached mini-
mum and becomes unchangeable at the end of NVT and NVE
ensembles to make sure that our systems have already been
equilibrated.

To calculate TC, the RNEMD [35,36] simulation is performed
on the well equilibrated structures to establish a temperature gra-
dient. In the RNEMD method, each of the simulation boxes is
divided into several slabs with a periodic boundary in the heat
transfer direction. As that shown in Fig. 2, the simulation system
is divided into several slabs (20 to 200 slabs, depending on the
chain length), slab 0 is the “hot” slab, and the slab N/2 is the
“cold” slab. Other slabs are used to obtain the temperature distri-
butions. The heat flux is created by exchanging velocities of par-
ticles in cold and hot slabs. The cold slab donates its “hottest”
particles (particles with the highest kinetic energy) to the hot slab
in exchange for the latter’s “coolest” particles (particles with the
lowest kinetic energy). Performing this exchange periodically
results in the heating up of the hot slab and cooling down of the
cold slab. This process eventually yields a steady-state tempera-
ture gradient due to thermal conduction through slabs separating
the cold and hot slabs. The TC is calculated exactly by the
relationship

branch-caused uncertainty less than 1.6% as listed in Table 1.Such a small difference between cross-sectional areas will not
lead to a large TC difference as that caused by branches (will be
discussed later). The TC present in this work could be scaled by a
different cross-sectional area for a comparison. With a time-step

of 1 fs, a total simulation time of 0.1 ns is taken to get a good lin-
ear temperature distribution. The temperature which is adopted to
calculate the temperature gradient is averaged through every 1000simulation steps (1 ps). The temperature fluctuation in the simula-
tion can be reduced by this average method. With heat flux printed
out every 0.1 ps, the TC is calculated at the last step. The tempera-
ture distribution in a PE chain with a length of 100 segments is
shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The linear temperature region is
fitted to obtain the temperature gradient for the calculation of the
effective TC by using the Fourier’s law. The TC calculated at dif-
ferent simulation times is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that 0.1 ns is
long enough to get a converged TC.

3 Results and Discussion

First, the length dependence of the TC of a pristine PE chain is
investigated and compared with that in early researches. And
then, the TC of the pristine PE chains with different lengths is
compared with that of a PE-ethyl chain. Third, the effect of the
branch arrangement is considered. Finally, the influence of the
branch type and the number density of branches are taken into
account.

3.1 Length Dependence of TC. Thermal conductivities of
the pristine PE chain with different chain lengths at 300 K are first
simulated and presented in Fig. 4(a). Previous works [14,37,38]about the pristine PE chains are also added in Fig. 4(a) for com-
parison. As that shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an obvious increase of
the TC with the increase of the chain length. Even with the length
increasing to be 200 nm, the TC still not converges, which sug-
gests that some portion of the phonons can still travel ballistically

in such a length. Our simulation work confirms that the TC of a
pristine PE chain will increase with the increasing number of seg-
ments (or chain length), and the TC of a single PE chain is several
orders of magnitude larger than that of a PE polymer. In Fig. 4(a),
the TC difference between different works should be attributed to
the application of different simulation methods, considering that
the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method is applied in our
and the work of Hu et al. and the equilibrium molecular dynamics
method is utilized in the work of Ni et al. and Liu and Yang. It
seems that a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method will
give a higher TC than an equilibrium molecular dynamics method.
This was also noticed in other studies [39,40], and some explana-
tions can be found there.

Plotting 1/k against 1/L in Fig. 4(b), we can see that with the
increase of 1/L, the 1/k first increases rapidly and then saturates to
a linear increase. The method by extrapolating the linear relation-
ship between the inverse of the TC (1/k) and the inverse of the
sample length (1/L) to get the TC with an infinite length fails.
This failure is attributed to the divergent thermal conductivity at
1/L! 0 where 1/k! 0, which has already been carefully studied
and explained with theoretical and molecular dynamics methods
in Ref. [41], more details can be found there.

Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain and the PE-
ethyl chain with lengths ranging from 100 to 500 segments (or
25.07–125.35 nm) are compared in Fig. 5. It turns out that both
TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain increase with
the increasing length, and the TC of a PE-ethyl chain is only about
75% that of a pristine PE chain. To illustrate the underlying mech-
anism of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain, the vibrational den-
sity of states (VDOS) is calculated by using the Fourier transform

of the velocity autocorrelation function. Results are compared
between the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain with 50 seg-
ments, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering the low-frequency
(<20 THz) phonons dominate the TC due to their high group
velocities and long MFPs [23], the lower VDOS of the PE-ethyl
chain in the low frequency should be responsible for the lower
TC, where the branch acts as a center of low-frequency-phonon
scattering.

To further illustrate the phonon scattering caused by the branch-
ing chains, the phonon spectral energy density (SED) of the pris-
tine PE and PE-ethyl chains is calculated based on the velocity
output of MD simulations. The atomic velocities are obtained by a
NVE simulation at a temperature of 300 K. The frequency resolu-
tion is selected to be 0.01 THz with 0.1 ns NVE simulations, and
the wave-number is 0.02j/(2p/a), where j¼ 2pn/aN, here a is the
lattice constant, N is the total number of unit cells along the heat
transfer direction (N¼ 50 in this work), and n is an integer ranging
from 0 to N 1. More details about the calculation can be found
in Refs. [42–45]. Results are shown in Fig. 7 with the shading sig-
nifying the magnitude of the SED. The SED of a pristine PE chain
in Fig. 7(a) coincides with that in Ref. [16] which confirms the
reliability of our calculation. For each phonon mode in Fig. 7, the
range of frequencies is related to the anharmonicity of the poten-
tial and the rate of the phonon scattering. The situation when
branch atoms move far away from equilibrium positions may lead
to a significant broadening of the peaks in Fig. 7. Fitting the shape
of peak and valley profiles of SED at all branches to the Lorent-
zian function [42–45], the phonon relaxation time is obtained and
shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the magnitude of the phonon relaxa-
tion time is greatly reduced by branching chains, which should be

responsible for the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain. The redistribu-
tion of phonons and the smearing acoustic branches of the
PE-ethyl chain in Fig. 7(b) proves the result in Fig. 8 that there is
a more severe phonon scattering for a PE-ethyl chain than a pris-
tine PE chain.

3.2 Influence of Branch Arrangements. The influence of
branch locations is considered in this part. For a pristine PE chain,
there are different locations from the simulation region boundary
to the branching ethyl. Five special locations are selected to
branch a short chain, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respec-
tively, as that shown in Fig. 9(a). The result in Fig. 9(b) confirms
that the presence of a branching chain can truly reduce the TC,
and the average TC of a PE-ethyl chain is about 0.7 times that of a
pristine PE chain. Our simulations also indicate that there is
almost a same TC for different locations in Fig. 9(b). This is
attributed to the periodic boundary condition in the simulation.
The small TC discrepancies between different locations should be
caused by the different distance of the branch from the simulation
boundary. If the boundary and the branching chains are both
thought as defects on a pristine PE chain, the TC with ethyl
located at the middle of the chain (P1) will be lower than other
TCs (P2, P3, P4, and P5), because of the small distance from the

middle of the chain to the system boundary. This is confirmed by
results in Fig. 9(b).

3.3 Influence of Branching Chain Types and Number Den-
sity of Branches. Seven different types of short chains are
branched on the middle segment of a PE chain, respectively, for
comparisons. They are different from the weight and the type of
chemical bonds between the backbone and the branch, as shown
in Fig. 10, which are listed as phenoxy group, phenyl group,
ethoxy group, methoxy group, ethyl group, ethylene group, and
hydroxy group, respectively. The black, red, and blue columns in
Fig. 10 stand for different chain lengths. The relative masses of
different branches are also shown in Fig. 10. We can see that all
types of branches can lead to a decrease of TC, and a heavy
branch leads to a lower TC than a light one, except for the ethyl-
ene group for which TC may be further decreased by a different
bond. It agrees with the conclusion in Ref. [23] that a chain modi-
fied by a heave atom possesses a lower TC than that modified by a
light one, where the modifying atom can be thought a special
short branch. We conclude that different branches will lead to a
different decrease of thermal conductivities because of the differ-
ent weights. More studies are still needed to probe the effect of
bonds between the backbone and the branch on the TC.

The effect of the number density of branches is studied in this
part. The number density of branches is defined as the number of
branches divided by the number of PE segments. Two hundred
segments (50.14 nm) are applied as a periodic unit in the simula-
tion, and the ethyl group is selected as the branch. Considering
there are different locations on a PE chain to branch an ethyl
group, we only consider two special location arrangements, i.e.,
the aligned arrangement and the fork arrangement, as that shown
in Fig. 11(a). For the aligned arrangement of ten branching ethyl,
they are equally distributed on the PE chain, only a part of the
chain is shown in Fig. 11(a); for the fork arrangement of ten
branching ethyl, every two branching ethyl are located at the same
segment of the PE chain, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). The corre-
sponding TC of these two arrangements is shown in Fig. 11(b). It
shows that a larger number density of branches leads to a lower
TC for both arrangements. With an increase of the number density
of branches, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain finally converges to be
only about 40% that of the pristine PE chain. This can be under-
stood by that with the increase of the number density, the distance
between branches is reduced, and the long-MFP phonons will be
decreased until the TC converges to a constant value. It can be
predicted that if a PE-ethyl chain instead of a pristine PE chain is
used to build up a polymer, the TC of the polymer will be much
reduced, because of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain and the
additional mass of branches. What kind of a chain will lead to a
lower TC is the key point of this paper, and more studies are still
needed to figure out the effect of long branches on the TC of a
pristine chain [24].

4 Conclusions

It is desirable to further reduce the TC of a polymer for devel-
oping a thermal insulation material. In this paper, we take
branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a chain.
With the RNEMD method, the TCs of the pristine PE chain and
the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. Influences of the
chain length, branch arrangements, types, and number density of
branches are considered. Our results suggest that the branch has a
positive effect to reduce the TC of a PE chain. If the number den-
sity of ethyl branches becomes larger than eight ethyls per 200segments, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain converges to be only about
40% that of a pristine PE chain. This conclusion will not be influ-
enced by the branch arrangements. Different branches cause a dif-
ferent decrease of thermal conductivities because of their different
weights, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one.
This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to
obtain a polymer with a low TC.

Nature 2018 ABSTRACT

The crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers and molecular orientation of

polymer have long been considered to be significant influencing factors on the

thermal conductivity of polymer materials, but more clear-cut understanding on

their impact on the thermal conductivity is still needed. In this work, poly-L-

lactide (PLLA), whose crystallinity and orientation can be adjusted in a wide

range, is selected to discuss the effect of degree of crystallinity and orientation

on the thermal conductivity of PLLA. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature

on the thermal conductivity is also discussed. PLLA compression-molded

samples were heat-treated at 120 C to tune the crystallinity of the samples,

while the degrees of orientation were tuned by stretching the amorphous PLLA

bars at 60 C to different strains. It is found that environmental temperature of

application affects the thermal conductivity obviously and the glass transition

temperature of polymers shows a strong influence on the thermal conductivity

of PLLA. Below Tg, the thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature and when the temperature is higher than Tg, the

thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity decreases remarkably.

It is also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of PLLA increases with the

increase in crystallinity, and the tensile strain linearly increases the thermal

conductivity in the direction of molecular orientation and decreases the thermal

conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which are in agreement with other

semicrystalline polymers that has been reported.

Introduction

With the rapid development of science and tech-

nologies, electric products are more and more highly

integrated, which urgently pushes the exploitation of

effective thermal management materials including

thermally conductive polymers and polymer com-

posites to be applied in various applications [1–7],

such as packaging, electronic devices and energy

storage. However, bulk polymers generally exhibit

very low thermal conductivity (TC) in the range of

0.1–0.5 W/(mK) [8, 9], so the development of poly-

mer materials with enhanced thermal conductivity

has become a great challenge to meet great increasing

demands [10–15]. It has been accepted that the

polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the overall TC

of polymer composites [16]. It is therefore necessary

to clearly clarify the influence of important factors

such as crystallinity and molecular orientation on the

TC of polymers.

Generally, crystalline polymers exhibit higher TC

than amorphous polymers due to the ordered struc-

ture, while the random chain conformation in amor-

phous polymers reduces the phonon mean free path

and causes phonon scattering [17]. In early study,

Hansen et al. [18] reported that the TC of high density

polyethylene can be improved by increasing the

crystallinity and lamellar thickness via tuning pro-

cessing conditions. Subsequently, Choy and co-

worker [19] found that the influence of crystallinity

on the TC of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was

affected by temperature. The TC of PET decreases

with increasing crystallinity at low temperature, but

increases with crystallinity at temperatures above

30 K. The peculiar behavior was interpreted from the

increasing thermal boundary resistance due to

acoustic mismatch at amorphous–crystalline interface

when the temperature is lowered. Crystallization was

also reported to be responsible for the higher TC in

other semicrystalline polymers [20, 21]. The higher

the crystallinity, the higher the thermal conductivity.

As heat transports more easily along polymer

chains than perpendicular to the polymer chain,

polymers exhibit significant anisotropy in their ther-

mally conductive properties [22]. Numerous experi-

mental studies on polymer chain orientation for TC

enhancement have been reported. As a typical

semicrystalline polymer, polyethylene (PE) has been

mostly used to study the effect of orientation on TC

[18, 23–28]. TC of other semicrystalline polymers

stretched to different draw ratio including poly-

oxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP),

polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET was also

studied [29]. The general result is that TC parallel to

the orientation direction rapidly increases with

increasing strain or draw ratio, while TC perpendic-

ular to the orientation direction decreases slightly.

But in these studies on the effect of the orientation,

TC was also influenced by the crystallization nature

of the polymers. To clarify how chain alignment

affects TC during drawing, purely amorphous poly-

mers were studied [30–34]. Early studies [31, 32] showed that the TC of stretched polymethyl

methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can be

increased in the stretching direction, but the increase

was small. However, it was found recently that

polythiophene nanofibers can achieve a TC up to

4.4 W/(m K), more than 20 times greater than the

bulk polymer through chain alignment [34]. Lu et al.

[35] also evidenced the molecular alignment in

amorphous region played a very important role in

the enhancement of thermal conductivity of

semicrystalline polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber.

PLLA is a plant-derived biodegradable polymer

material. However, low thermal conductivity restricts

its application in engineering and electronic fields. To

expand the applications of PLLA, many studies have

been conducted to improve the TC of PLLA via

compounding with thermally conductive fillers

[36–41], but the basic influencing factors from the

polymer itself have not been well addressed, which is

hopefully to provide supporting for fabrication of

high thermally conductive PLLA composites. Also,

owing to that PLLA exhibits very low crystallization

kinetics [42–44], the amorphous state by quenching

and a wide range of degrees of crystallinity by

isothermal crystallization at different temperature for

different periods of time can be easily achieved [45].

These features provide a good candidate to elucidate

the effect of crystallinity and molecular orientation on

the TC of semicrystalline polymers.

In this study, the crystallinity of PLLA was tuned

by melt crystallization at 120 C for different minutes.

Various degrees of orientation of PLLA were realized

by stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C with

the same speed to different strains. WAXD was car-

ried out to characterize the crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA. DSC, density measurement and

laser flash method were performed together to reveal

10544 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 the relation between TC and crystallinity, tempera-

ture and orientation of molecular chains. The results

showed that TC of PLLA with different crystallinity

was affected obviously by ambient temperature and

the maximum value appeared at Tg. TC of PLLA

increases with increasing crystallinity, and TC of

PLLA parallel to the orientation direction increases

with increasing tensile strain, while the one perpen-

dicular to the stretching direction decreases with

increasing strain. These results can further manifest

the effect of crystallinity and orientation on the

thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers.

Also, this systematic study can provide supporting

for fabricating enhanced thermally conductive PLLA

composites.

Experimental section

Materials and sample preparation

PLLA (trade name 4032D, Nature Works LLC) was

used. The average weight molecular weight (Mw) and

the polydispersity index (PDI) are 2.1 9 105 g/mol

and 1.7. The melting temperature is 167.2 C, mea-

sured by differential scanning calorimetry at a heat-

ing rate of 10 C/min.

PLLA granules were dried in a blast drying oven at

60 C for 12 h, and then melted in the mixer of a

torque rheometer with a rotational speed of 50 rpm at

190 C for 5 min. After that, the resulted materials

were compressed into sheets with the thickness of

about 0.5 mm at 190 C for 3 min under a pressure of

10 MPa. The melted PLLA sheet was immediately

transferred to isothermal crystallization at 120 C for

different minutes (0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 40 min)

under a pressure of 10 MPa and then cooled quickly

to obtain samples with different crystallinity. The

resulted samples were designated as 120-X min, in

which X stands for the compression time at 120 C.
Round disks with the diameter of 12.7 mm were cut

from the 120-X min PLLA sheets for WAXD and

thermal diffusivity tests. Rectangular-shaped sample

bars with the dimension of 20 mm (width) 9 80.0 mm (length) were cut from amorphous 120-0 min

PLLA sheets, and then stretched uniaxially at 60 C
using an Instron 5967 universal material testing

machine at a stretching rate of 20 mm/min. The

tensile strain was controlled to be 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The stretched bars designated as 60-20-Y, in which

Y stands for the tensile strain, were measured by 2D wide angel X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to determine

the degree orientation. Both the through-plane and

in-plane thermal diffusivities of the stretched bars

were tested.

Characterization

WAXD measurements and data analysis

WAXD measurement of PLLA compression sheets

isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different min-

utes was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffrac-

tometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k = 0.154 nm,

40 kV, 25 mA) in the scanning range of 2h = 5–60 at
a scan speed of 10/min at room temperature. The

crystallinity was determined from the fractional area

of the crystalline peaks to the total area [46].

WAXD measurement of PLLA samples stretched to

different strains at 60 C with the speed of 20 mm/

min was carried out on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER 2D X-ray diffractometer with the reflection mode. The

X-ray was generated using ImS micro Focus X-ray

source generator with Cu target (k = 0.154 nm, 40 kV,

40 mA). The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns were

recorded on a VANTEC-500 detector system with a

pixel size of 68 9 68 mm2. The distance from the

sample to detector was 198 mm. The spot size of the

beam was 0.5 mm.

Density measurement

The density of PLLA compression-molded samples

with different crystallinity was measured by using

MH-120E density meter according to Archimedes

principle.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement

The empty pan, sapphire standard and PLLA com-

pression-molded samples with different crystallinity

were measured by DSC (Q20, TA company). Samples

were measured from - 80 to 90 C with heating rate

of 10 C/min under nitrogen gas flow of 50 mL/min.

Thermal conductivity measurement by laser flash method

The sample preparation processes for the thermal

diffusivity measurements are outlined in Fig. S1. Before testing, the thickness and length or diameter

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10545 of the samples were measured, and then both sur-

faces of the samples were evenly sprayed with a thin

graphite layer. The sample was then fixed according

to the required test pattern and placed in the test

chamber (LFA 467, Netzsch). PLLA compression-

molded samples with different crystallinity were

tested in the temperature ranging from - 70 to 80 C,
while the PLLA stretched samples with different

degree of orientation were tested at 25 C.

Results and discussion

Effect of temperature and crystallinity
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

WAXD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sam-

ples isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different

period of time are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that

the quenched PLLA compression-molded sample

without isothermal crystallization (120-0 min) shows

only a very broad diffraction peak of amorphous

phase without any traces of crystalline peaks, clearly

showing the amorphous nature of the sample owing

to the extremely slow crystallization kinetics of

PLLA. After isothermal crystallizing at 120 C, the
WAXD profile of the isothermally crystallized PLLA

samples shows three peaks at 2h = 16.7, 19.0 and

22.3, respectively, corresponding to the diffraction

peaks of (200)/(110), (203) and (015) planes of a
crystalline structure of PLLA. The diffraction inten-

sity of the peaks increases with the extension of

isothermal crystallization time, showing that

isothermal treatment at 120 C can effectively pro-

mote the crystallization of PLLA. By Gauss fitting of

the WAXD profiles, the crystallinity of all the samples

was calculated and is listed in Table 1. The results

demonstrate that the crystallinity of PLLA isother-

mally crystallized at 120 C increases with the

extension of isothermal crystallizing time, and can

even reach up to a level higher than 50%.

The different crystallinity of PLLA samples leads to

the differences of densities, which are listed in

Table 2. It can be seen that although the crystallinity

varies in a great range after crystallizing at 120 C for

different time, the change in density, showing a slight

increasing trends, is quite limited. However, when

the crystallinity increases, the ratio of the ordered

molecular chains in the system increases, leading to

the decrease in the volume of the sample. That is why

the density of PLLA increases a little with the

increasing of crystallinity.

The specific heat (Cp) was obtained by DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, America) at a heating rate of 10 C/
min. The Cp values of PLLA compression samples

with different crystallinity are calculated by Eq. (1):

Cp ¼ Cp0m0h= mHð Þ ð1Þ where Cp and Cp0, m and m0, h and H are the specific

heat, the weight and the heat flow of PLLA sample

and sapphire standard, respectively. The specific heat

of sapphire standard is given in the DSC software.

The calculated specific heat of PLLA samples is

shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the specific heat

increases linearly before 50 C. An abrupt increase in

the specific heat is observed in the glass transition

temperature range (50–70 C), resulting from the

change of free volume of PLLA [47], and then specific

heat remains constant for the samples with given

crystallinity after Tg. Thermal diffusivities of PLLA

samples with different crystallinity were measured

by laser flash method, which is a non-contact tran-

sient thermal measurement method widely used for

measuring the thermal diffusivity (a). With all these

parameters, the thermal conductivity of the samples

can be derived through Eq. (2):

k ¼ a q Cp ð2Þ where q is the bulk density and Cp is the specific heat

at a given pressure.

The thermal diffusivity and the thermal conduc-

tivity of PLLA samples with different crystallinity are

isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different time.

10546 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows that the thermal

diffusivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity reduces moderately due to the decrease in

the phonon mean free path when the temperature

rises, but drops abruptly within the glass transition

temperature range. Taking 120-40 as an example, the

thermal diffusivity decreases by 0.033 mm2/s from

- 70 to 60 C, but decreases by 0.017 mm2/s sharply

only from 60 to 80 C. The sudden drop can be

explained in terms of molecular mobility [48]. But it

should be noted that the abrupt drop trend around Tg

becomes gentler with increasing crystallinity of PLLA

samples. It can be understood from the fact that the

crystallized fractions refine the amorphous phase of

PLLA to a certain degree and hinder the molecular

motion in amorphous regions which will reduce the

phonon mean free path, especially at temperatures

near the glass transition.

Figure 3b shows the relationship between thermal

conductivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity and temperature. It can be found that the

environmental temperature affects the thermal con-

ductivity obviously. Notably, the glass transition

temperature exerts a great influence on the thermal

conductivity. In the glass state below Tg, thermal

conductivities of all the PLLA samples with different

crystallinity increase with temperature. In this tem-

perature range, two mechanisms with opposite

effects operate [48]. The thermal diffusivity decreases

with temperature increasing, while the increase in

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10547 specific heat attributes more to the thermal conduc-

tivity. The net effect is a smooth and moderate

increase in thermal conductivity with temperature

increasing. When the temperature is further

increased, the amorphous phase of PLLA sample gets

into rubbery state, and the molecular chains of the

amorphous phase begin to move, leading to a great

reduction in the phonon mean free path. So, the

thermal conductivity decreases remarkably. Such a

process produces the maximum of the thermal con-

ductivity near the glass transition temperature in the

range of the measured temperatures. Meanwhile, it

also can be seen that the thermal conductivity of

PLLA samples increases with the increase in crys-

tallinity of PLLA.

To further analyze the effect of the crystallinity on

the thermally conductive properties of PLLA, the

thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA samples at different temperatures

are presented as a function of crystallinity in Fig. 4. The specific heat changes linearly with the increase in

crystallinity of PLLA at different temperatures. The

slope of the fitting curve decreases from 0.118 to

- 0.46 with increasing temperature. It shows that the

specific heat of PLLA decreases with increasing

crystallinity when the temperature is higher than Tg,

due to that Cp for amorphous phase is larger than

crystal phase [49]. However, specific heat of PLLA

samples increases slowly with the increasing crys-

tallinity at temperatures below Tg. Thermal diffusiv-

ity of PLLA increases linearly with increasing

crystallinity, and the increasing rate keeps stable at

the temperatures below Tg, while the increasing rate

increases after Tg. When the amorphous phase is in

the rubber state, the motion of the molecular chains

reduces the phonon mean free path obviously, while

with the increasing crystallinity, the mean free path

increases distinctly. That is why the thermal diffu-

sivity increases obviously with increasing crys-

tallinity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of PLLA

samples as a result of the specific heat and thermal

diffusivity increases with increasing crystallinity.

at given temperatures.

10548 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 Though the specific heat decreases with increasing

crystallinity after Tg, the thermal diffusivity com-

pensates more for the thermal conductivity. The

increase in thermal conductivity of PLLA samples

with increasing crystallinity is in agreement with that

of other semi-crystallized polymers. However, it

should be noted that TC of PLLA is not significantly

increased with crystallinity. TC of PLLA with the

crystallinity of 56% (120-40) is 0.196 W/mK at 20 C,
only 0.025 W/mK larger than the thermal conduc-

tivity of amorphous PLLA (120-0).

Effect of molecular orientation
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

To obtain PLLA with different degrees of orientation

and to exclude the influence of crystallization,

amorphous PLLA rectangle samples (120-0 min)

were stretched to different strains uniaxially at 60 C
with the stretching rate of 20 mm/min. Different

positions were marked on the original bars. It is

found in Fig. S2(a) that the strain of every marked

length is consistent, which provides us proof for our

assumption that the orientation of different positions

on the tensile bar is similar. Taking 60-20-4 as an

example, 2D WAXD patterns of different positions on

the tensile bar are shown in Fig. S2(b) to verify the

degree of orientation. It shows that WAXD diffrac-

tions of the three different positions are almost the

same on the meridian and the isotropic scattering

halo develops into the two arcs along the meridian.

From the azimuth scan curve, it can be seen that the

curves of the ‘‘upper, middle, down’’ parts are basi-

cally also the same. These results indicate that

degrees of orientation of different positions along

drawing direction of the tensile bar are the same, and

the differences are negligible. This facilitates subse-

quent preparation of specimens for tests of in-plane

thermal diffusivity.

The middle part of PLLA bars stretched to different

strains is chosen to measure the degrees of orienta-

tion by 2D WAXD. The 2D WAXD patterns are

shown in Fig. 5. The un-stretched PLLA shows reg-

ular concentric rings, indicating that the initial PLLA

bar is amorphous and isotropic. With the increase in

tensile strain, the isotropic halo gradually concen-

trates to the meridian, which indicates that amor-

phous chains of PLLA samples get orientated

gradually along the drawing direction, and the

strength increases gradually. In this process, no

obvious crystal diffraction occurs. The meridian

intensity profiles extracted from the WAXD patterns

in Fig. 5b also show a very broad scattering peak of

amorphous phase without any traces of crystalline

phases. These results clearly demonstrated that the

stretched PLLA bars with different strains are all

amorphous and a series of PLLA with different

degrees of orientation have been achieved to further

reveal the influence of orientation on the thermal

conductivity of PLLA.

Both the in-plane and through-plane thermal dif-

fusivity of the stretched and un-stretched PLLA

samples were measured at 25 C. The thermal

intensity profiles (b) extracted from the WAXD patterns.

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10549 conductivities are calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the

specific heat and the density are constant, which are

the values of the aforementioned PLLA 120-0 min

(specific heat: 1.195 J/g K, density: 1.243 g/cm3). The

results are shown in Fig. 6. The relation between

thermal diffusivity in the in-plane direction and

tensile strain is opposite to the relation between

thermal diffusivity in the through-plane direction

and tensile strain. The thermal diffusivity in the in-

plane direction increases as the tensile strain increa-

ses, while the thermal diffusivity of PLLA samples in

the through-plane direction decreases with the

increase in tensile strain. This is owing to that the

thermal energy transports more efficiently parallel to

the tensile direction, i.e., along the polymer chain,

which consists of the strong covalent bonds, than

perpendicular to the polymer chain, where the ther-

mal energy is carried by the means of weak van der

Waals interaction of molecules [22]. That is to say, the

phonon mean free path along the tensile direction (in-

plane direction) is larger than that perpendicular to

the tensile direction (through-plane direction).

Therefore, with the increase in orientation, the ther-

mal diffusivity in the in-plane direction increases,

while the one in the through-plane direction decrea-

ses. As the specific heat and density are constant, the

variation of thermal conductivity (k) with the degree

of orientation is consistent with the variation of the

thermal diffusivity with the degree of orientation.

The thermal conductivity in the in-plane direction

(k//) increases linearly with the increase in tensile

strain, and thermal conductivity in the through-plane

direction (k\) decreases linearly with the increase in

tensile strain. When the tensile strain is 4, the TC in

the in-plane direction of PLLA is 0.348 W/mK, while

the TC in the through-plane direction decreases to

0.125 W/mK. The relative thermal conductivities (k/

k0)-strain data are also given in Fig. 7, showing that

the relative in-plane thermal conductivity (k///k0) is

low, only around 2 when tensile strain reaches to 4. Such a linear relationship between k (k// and k\) and

strain and low relative in-plane thermal conductivity

have also been observed previously for other amor-

phous polymers such as PS, PMMA, PC, etc. [30, 32].

þ ð2=k?Þ ð3Þ TC in the directions parallel and perpendicular to

which would indeed bear the relationship of Eq. (3) to a neutral plane conductivity in uniaxially oriented

polymer. However, there is no fundamental reason

why this neutral plane conductivity is the same as the

conductivity of an unoriented specimen [32]. The

corresponding parameters in Eq. 3 of PLLA are listed

in Table 3. It is found that the thermal conductivities

of the oriented and unoriented PLLA conform with

the relationship of Eq. 3. Conclusion

In this work, different crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA were fabricated by isothermal

crystallization at 120 C for different minutes and

stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C at the

same speed to different strains, respectively. We have

demonstrated the effect of temperature, crystallinity

and degree of orientation on the thermal conductivity

of bulk PLLA samples. The thermal conductivity of

PLLA with different crystallinity was affected obvi-

ously by temperature. Before Tg, the thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature, mainly resulting from

the increasing specific heat. As the temperature is

further increased to be higher than Tg, the thermal

conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

decreases remarkably due to the obvious drop of

thermal diffusivity. It demonstrates that thermal

conductivity of PLLA increases with the increase in

crystallinity, but the increasing rate is quite limited.

With orientation, the conductivity was increased in

the direction of molecular orientation and decreased

in the perpendicular direction. The reciprocal of the

two thermal conductivities in different directions of

PLLA stretched to different strains fit a linear

relationship.

Available online 16 October 2012 Abstract

The effects of boron nitride (BN) content and particle size on the thermal properties of BN/high density polyethylene (HDPE)

composites were investigated. The thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of the composites were dependent on the BN content.

For composites with same amount of BN, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with an increase in the size of the

BN particles. Composites with a mixture of different-sized BN particles exhibited higher thermal conductivities than those of composites

with single-sized BN particles. The specific heat capacities of the composites were also affected by the BN content and particle size.

Several theoretical models were employed to predict the effective thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted values were

compared with those obtained experimentally.

1. Introduction

For electronic packaging applications, materials with high
thermal conductivities are required to dissipate the heat
generated by the electronic component effectively. Polymers
are often used in these applications, in addition to being
employed as substrate materials, because of their low dielectric
properties and ease of processing. However, the thermal
conductivities of polymers are usually very low. Therefore,
there is a need to investigate ceramics-filled polymer compo-
sites that have high thermal conductivities [1–4].

Generally, the thermal conductivity of ceramic-filled
polymer composites increases with increasing ceramic
content and particle size. Particles with a high aspect ratio
such as flake- or fibre-shaped particles exhibit the bridging
phenomenon to a larger degree. This assists in the forma-
tion of a conductive path because the percolation threshold
for such particles is lower than that of spherical particles.
However, high-aspect-ratio particles have low packing
densities due to their increased porosity [3]. Usage of a
mixture of different-sized ceramic particles would increase
the thermal conductivity of composites [5–8], as the
e front matter & 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd and Techna G

g/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.137 ing author. Tel.: þ82 31 249 9764; fax: þ82 31 244 6300. ess: eskim@kyonggi.ac.kr (E.S. Kim).
packing densities of such composites would be higher than
those of composites with single-sized ceramic particles.
Flakes of BN were used as the filler in this study due to

their high conductivity, excellent temperature resistance,
light-weight nature, and moderate cost [1]. High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) was used as the polymer matrix since
HDPE is an engineering thermo-plastic used in several
industrial applications due to its low cost, desirable
mechanical properties, and ease of processing.
Therefore, the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE com-

posites was investigated on the basis of the volume fraction
(Vf) and size of the BN flakes. In addition, several
theoretical models were employed to predict the effective
thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted
values were compared with those obtained experimentally.

2. Experimental procedures

Powders (99.5%, Changsung Corp., Korea) comprising
BN flakes of different sizes were chosen as the fillers for the
polymer matrix composites. The sizes of the BN flakes in
the ceramic powders used in this study were 3 mm, 10 mm,
and 20 mm. HDPE (99.9%, Yuhwa Korea Petrochemical
Ind. Co., Korea) was used as a matrix for the composites.
The BN powders and HDPE were weighed as per the
roup S.r.l.

200 1C at a speed of 30 rpm for 20 min. The mixture was
hot-pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa for 30 min at
200 1C and cooled to room temperature.

The apparent densities of the composites were measured
by the Archimedes’ method. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (D/Max-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Japan) was used to
determine the content and the size of the particles in the
BN powders. The microstructures of the composites were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-
6500F, Jeol, Japan). The specific heat capacities (Cp) and
the thermal diffusivities were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model DSC 200F3, Netzsch,
Germany) and by a laser flash apparatus (LFA) (Model
LFA447, Netzsch, Germany), respectively. The thermal
conductivities of the composites were obtained using their
densities, specific heat capacities, and thermal diffusivities.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Physical properties of composites

The X-ray diffraction patterns for the BN/HDPE
composites with various volume fractions (Vf) and
BN-particle sizes are shown in Fig. 1. The semi-
crystalline phase of HDPE and the single crystalline phase
of BN (JCPDS no. 37-109) could be detected. With an
increase in the BN content, the intensity of the peak for
HDPE decreased. For a given BN content, the intensity of
the peak for HDPE increased with a decrease in the size of
the BN particles.

The peaks for the composites with a mixture of 3 mm-
and 20 mm-sized BN particles exhibited intensities that
were between the intensities of the peaks for the compo-
sites with BN particles with sizes of 3 mm and 20 mm,

respectively. The XRD patterns did not show peaks for
any reaction compounds of BN and HDPE, suggesting
that no chemical reaction took place between the BN
particles and HDPE.
Fig. 2 shows the apparent and theoretical densities of the

composites with various volume fractions (Vf). The appar-
ent and theoretical densities of the composites increased
with an increase in the BN content as the density of the BN
particles is higher than that of HDPE. For composites with
same amount of BN particles, the apparent density did not
change markedly with BN-particle size. With increasing
BN content, the difference between the apparent and
theoretical densities of the composites increased because
of the pores induced at the interface between polymer and
ceramics [3].
SEM micrographs of the composites with various

volume fractions and BN-particle sizes are shown in
Fig. 3. With increasing BN content (Fig. 3(a–c)), the
distance between the BN particles decreased. That is to
say that connectivity among the BN particles as well as the
interfacial area between BN and HDPE increased. The
composites with a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN
particles showed larger conductive networks than did the
composites with single-sized BN particles (Fig. 3(d) and
(e)). The composites with various volume fractions and
BN-particle sizes had the BN particles uniformly dispersed
within the HDPE matrix, with melted HDPE completely
covering the BN particles, resulting in the low porosity of
the composites.

3.2. Thermal properties of composite

The thermal diffusivities and specific heat capacities of
the composites with various volume fractions and BN-
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. With increasing BN
content, the thermal diffusivity of the composites
increased, while the specific heat capacity decreased. These

Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573 S571results are due to the fact that the thermal diffusivity of BN
is higher than that of HDPE, and its specific heat capacity is
lower than that of HDPE. The thermal diffusivity of the

composites increased with an increase in the size of the BN
particles due to the decrease in the interfacial thermal
barrier between BN and HDPE. However, the specific heat
capacity of the composites did not change markedly with
the size of the BN particles. A similar tendency has been
confirmed in BN/polybenzoxazine composites [9].
Fig. 4 shows the experimentally determined and theore-

tically calculated thermal conductivities of the composites
with various volume fractions and BN-particle sizes. The
experimentally determined thermal conductivity of the
composites increased with increasing BN content due to
the thermal conductivity of BN being higher than that of
HDPE. For a given ceramic content, the thermal con-
ductivity of the composites increased with increasing BN-
particle size because the heat conducting paths were
thicker and the junctions had lower thermal resistance in
the composites with the larger particles of BN than in the
composites with smaller BN particles.
For electronic packaging applications, the ability to

predict the thermal conductivity of the composites effec-
tively should be considered when designing ceramic/poly-
mer composites with high thermal conductivity. Several
theoretical models were employed to predict the thermal
conductivity of the composites with various volume frac-
tions and BN-particle sizes. The Bruggeman and Russell

Y.K. Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573S572models [6] were not used to fit the experimental data due to
the fact that the fillers used in this study were not spherical
or cubic in shape. However, the Nielsen–Lewis model
[6,10] was in good agreement with the experimental values
well up to Vf of 0.4, above which the model failed because
of the presence of pores, as shown in Fig. 4. This result is due to the fact that, unlike the other
models, the Nielsen–Lewis model includes a fitting para-
meter A (morphology factor) to describe the shape of the
filler. The Nielsen–Lewis model is based on the following
equation:

where leff, lp, and lc are the thermal conductivities of the
composites, polymer, and ceramic, respectively; Vf is
the volume faction of the ceramic; constant A is related
to the morphology of the composites (irregular-shaped
particles have a larger value of A than do spherical
particles (A¼1.5)); fm is maximum packing fraction. For
composites with same amount of BN particles, the values
of A and fm increased with increasing BN-particle sizes
(Fig. 4).

Fig. 5 shows the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE
composites with the volume fraction of BN equal to Vf of
0.3 and a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles.
For the composites with the Vf of 0.3 and a mixture of
3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles, the thermal conduc-
tivity increased when Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles was
0.09. It then decreased with a further increase in the
volume fraction of the 3 mm-sized BN particles. These
results can be explained by the fact that the 3 mm-sized BN
particles fill the space between the 20 mm-sized BN parti-
cles until Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles reaches 0.09(Fig. 3(f)). This leads to an increase in the number of
conductive paths.

4. Conclusions

With increasing BN content, the thermal conductivities
and the thermal diffusivities of BN/HDPE composites
increased, while the specific heat capacities decreased.
For a given BN content, the thermal conductivity and
the thermal diffusivity of the composites increased with an
increase in the sizes of the BN particles. However, the
specific heat capacity of the composites did not change
markedly with the BN-particle size. The thermal conduc-
tivity of composites containing a mixture of different-sized
BN particles was higher than that of composites contain-
ing only single-sized BN particles (3 mm or 20 mm). The
experimentally determined values of thermal conductivity
were in good agreement with those obtained using the
Nielsen–Lewis model.

Influence of the Molecular Architecture of Low-Density
Polyethylene on the Texture and Mechanical Properties
of Blown Films

Received 7 February 2002; revised 30 April 2002; accepted 31 October 2002 ABSTRACT: Three types of low-density polyethylene materials were investigated with
respect to the influence of the molecular architecture on the mechanical and use
properties of blown films. The materials were a branched polyethylene synthesized by
free-radical polymerization under high-pressure (HP-LDPE), a linear ethylene–hexene
copolymer (ZN-LLDPE) produced by low-pressure Ziegler–Natta catalysis, and an
ethylene–hexene copolymer (M-LLDPE) from metallocene catalysis. The extrusion and
blowing conditions were identical for the three materials, with a take-up ratio of 12 and
a blow-up ratio of 2.5. The blown films displayed a decreasing puncture resistance in
the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and HP-LDPE. In parallel, the tear resistance of the
films became increasingly unbalanced in the same order of the polymers. The morpho-
logical study showed an increased anisotropy of the films in the same polymer order, the
crystalline lamellae being increasingly oriented normal to the take-up direction. This
texturing caused a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the films, notably
increasing the capacity for crack propagation. The phenomenon was ascribed to the
kinetics of chain relaxation in the melt that governed the ability of the chains to recover
an isotropic state from the flow-induced stretching before crystallization. The puncture
resistance was examined in terms of both texture and strain-hardening capabilities.

INTRODUCTION

Since the early 1970s, ethylene/-olefin copoly-
mers synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysis have
been largely developed in the domain of blown
films for packaging applications, in concurrence
with low-density polyethylenes (PEs) produced by
high-pressure free-radical polymerization. In re-

cent years, copolymers issued from metallocene
technology have taken an increasing place in the
field of film blowing because of excellent optical
properties combined with remarkable mechanical
performances.1 For the processing difficulties of
metallocene copolymers due to narrow molar
weight distributions (MWDs), technical solutions
have been found by either the incorporation of
very low amounts of long side chains or the pro-
duction of bimodal MWDs.2,3 There is, however,
much work left to do to understand the property
upgrade of such novel materials, notably for film
applications.

The influence of molecular orientation on the
use properties of PE blown films has stimulated
profuse studies on the processing–structure and
processing–property relationships.4–31 Neverthe-
less, little has been accomplished in terms of un-
derstanding the influence of the molecular archi-
tecture on the structure and mechanical proper-
ties of films, via processing conditions. This study
focused on three types of low-density PE issued
from three different types of polymerization tech-
niques. The differences in the use properties of
the blown films were analyzed through the crys-
talline texture under similar processing condi-
tions for the various polymers.

EXPERIMENTAL

Three low-density PE materials from various
sources were studied. The molecular and physical
characteristics of the materials are shown in Ta-
ble 1. M-LLDPE and ZN-LLDPE were linear eth-
ylene–hexene copolymers synthesized by metal-
locene and Ziegler–Natta catalysts, respectively.
The former one, with a narrower MWD, was sus-
pected to contain a few long side chains on the
basis of elongational viscosity. HP-LDPE was is-
sued from the high-pressure free-radical polymer-
ization of ethylene in an autoclave. It contained
long-chain branches (LCBs) and short-chain
branches (SCBs) mainly composed of butyl side
groups with minor amounts of ethyl side
groups.32 Tubular blown films, about 50 m thick, were
processed with an annular die extruder with a
15-cm diameter and a 1.5-mm gap. For the sake of
comparison of the blown-film properties, the pro-
cessing conditions were kept as close as possible
for the three materials: flow rate  40 kg/h, melt
temperature at the die  190 °C, frost-line height
 50 cm, take-up speed  12 m/min, take-up ratio
(TUR) 12 in the so-called machine direction
(MD), and blow-up ratio (BUR)  2.5 in the trans-

verse direction (TD). These conditions corre-
sponded to the optimum blowing capabilities of
HP-LDPE. The direction perpendicular to the film
surface was defined as the normal direction (ND).

For the evaluation of the intrinsic properties of
the materials, 1-mm-thick isotropic sheets were
also prepared. Pellets were compression-molded
for 5 min at 180 °C and subsequently crystallized
by being cooled to room temperature (RT) at
about 20 °C/min.

The relaxation time, , of the materials in the
melt was determined from viscoelastic measure-
ments at 190 °C with a Rheometric RSA II appa-
ratus in the cone–plane configuration. The assess-
ment of  was made from the Cole–Cole diagram
of the loss shear modulus versus the storage
shear modulus.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) mea-
surements were performed on a PerkinElmer
DSC-7 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The calibration of the temperature scale was
achieved from the melting scans of high-purity
indium and zinc samples at the same heating
rate. The melting point (Tf) of the materials was
determined at the peak of the melting endotherm
of the heating scan following standard cooling
from the melt at 10 °C/min.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used
to investigate the crystalline lamellar morphology
and texture of the films. The X-ray beam was
provided by a Rigaku Cu rotating anode having a
0.1 mm focus and operated at 30 kV and 40 mA.
An assembly of two Ni-coated curved mirrors at a
right angle was used for a punctual collimation of
the incident beam. The scattered intensity was
detected with a position-sensitive linear counter
selecting Cu K X-ray photons. It was located at
80 cm of the sample, with a vacuum section be-
tween the detector and sample. For optimum X-
ray absorption, approximately 2-mm-thick sam-
ples were made by several pieces of films or com-
pression-molded sheets being piled up. For blown
films, the through-view scattering curves were

recorded parallel to both MD and TD. Edge-view
scattering curves were also recorded parallel to
MD and ND. For a comparison of the scattering
intensity profiles versus the scattering vector of
the various materials, all the intensity data in
arbitrary units were corrected for the background
scattering, absorption, and Lorentz factor.33 The
transmission coefficient for every sample was de-
termined from the ratio of the peak intensities of
the incident beam with and without the sample.
The intercrystalline long period, L, was directly
determined from the correlation peak of the in-
tensity profile. The average crystal thickness, Lc,
was assessed from the equation Lc  Lc, which
assumes much greater length and width of the
crystalline lamellae than their thickness. The
crystal volume fraction, c, was computed from
the density, , of the material with the relation c

 (  a)/(c  a), where c  1.000 g/cm3 and a

 0.855 g/cm are the densities of perfectly crys-
talline orthorhombic PE and amorphous PE, re-
spectively.34 Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experi-
ments were performed in the transmission mode
with monochromatic Cu K radiation. Through-
view patterns on films were recorded on a two-
dimensional CCD camera.

The tear and puncture resistance of the blown
films were determined at RT according to the
standard Elmendorf test (ASTM D 1922) and dart
impact test (ASTM D 1709), respectively. Conven-
tional tensile stress–strain measurements were
carried out at RT on an Instron testing machine
at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min, with dumb-
bell samples 100 mm in gauge length. Both iso-
tropic sheets and films were tested. For films,
tensile experiments were carried out along MD
and TD. The reported curves are representative of
three different measurements.

Shrinkage measurements of the blown films
above Tf were carried out with 5 cm  5 cm
specimens suspended by small clamps into an
oven at 130 °C for 5 min. Shrinkage data along
MD and TD were assessed from the ratio of the
dimension change to the initial dimension of the
film piece. Experiments at various temperatures
between 125 and 135 °C showed some tempera-
ture dependence of the M-LLDPE shrinkage,
whereas ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE proved to be
almost insensitive. However, the ranking of the
materials in terms of shrinkage capacity did not
depend on temperature.

TEAR AND PUNCTURE RESISTANCE OF
THE FILMS

An examination of the dart impact data of films in
Table 2 shows that HP-LDPE has the lowest
puncture resistance of the three materials. More-
over, the perforation of HP-LDPE films appears
as an elongated crack parallel to TD. In contrast,
ZN-LLDPE exhibits an elongated perforation par-
allel to MD. M-LLDPE displays the best film
puncture resistance, and the perforation is fairly
circular. These observations are relevant to the
structural anisotropy of both HP-LDPE and ZN-
LLDPE, whereas M-LLDPE looks rather iso-
tropic.

Under tear testing, HP-LDPE displays the low-
est capabilities of the three materials. It is nota-
bly unbalanced, with a higher tear resistance in
MD. The better tear performances of M-LLDPE
are fairly well equilibrated along MD and TD.
M-LLDPE is challenged by ZN-LLDPE with re-
spect to the level of tear resistance, even though
the latter displays nonequilibrated properties,
the higher tear resistance being in TD.

In summary, the puncture and tear properties
of M-LLDPE are fairly high and isotropic despite
the largely unbalanced TUR and BUR of the
films. In contrast, HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE re-
veal strong anisotropy along TD and MD that
suggests chain orientation and/or crystalline tex-
turing of the films. The anisotropy effect is, how-
ever, opposite in the two materials, despite iden-
tical blowing conditions: ZN-LLDPE is more tear-
resistant in TD than in MD, whereas HP-LDPE
displays greater tear resistance in MD. Similar
observations of opposite behavior between linear
PE films11,15,23,24,30 and branched PE films20,28 can be found in the literature for usual blowing
conditions notably involving TUR  BUR. This
surprising finding suggests that the intuitive pic-
ture of an improved tear resistance normal to the

in most cases, does work for ZN-LLDPE but does
not work for HP-LDPE. Otherwise, it was pro-
posed by Kim and coworkers23,24 and Andre et
al.29 that crystalline lamellar orientation might
be more important than the molecular orientation
with respect to tear resistance because lamellae
are likely to act as obstacles to crack propagation.
This is the reason for the following structural
study.

STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE

Compression-Molded Sheets

For the three kinds of PE studied, the SAXS data
of Table 3 reveal very similar if not equal crystal
thicknesses for isotropic sheets and films. This is
relevant to the relatively low sensitivity of low-
density PE materials to the cooling rate, that is,
about 20°/s for blown films and 20°/min for com-
pression-molded sheets.

Considering the densities of the materials under
investigation and using the data from Kuhn and
Krömer,32 we can assume a butyl SCB rate of about
17/1000 C (where C is a carbon atom of the polymer
backbone) for HP-LDPE, whereas a rough figure of
18/1000 C can be assumed for the butyl SCB con-
centration of both ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE ac-
cording to various literature data.23,35,36 Under
such considerations, it turns out that the average
distance between short branches along the main
chain is about 7 nm. The quite good consistency of
this figure with the crystal thickness of the materi-
als reported in Table 3 supports the largely ac-
cepted scheme of an exclusion from the crystalline
phase of the SCB having two carbon atoms or more.
As a matter of fact, if the SCB bulkiness prevents
the counit inclusion in the crystal lattice due to
crystal growth, one should expect Lc to be governed

by the average length of the crystallizable methyl-
ene sequences.37 M-LLDPE and HP-LDPE have somewhat
lower Lc values (Table 3) than ZN-LLDPE, with
a concomitant lower Tf. This is relevant to the
more uniform distribution of the counits or
SCBs of the former two materials. Heteroge-
neous ZN copolymers are indeed well known to
grow thicker crystals with higher Tf values than
homogeneous copolymers or branched PEs of
similar crystallinity38 – 40 because of almost
counit-free chains. This is an advantage for
some applications such as hot tack but is prej-
udicial for optical properties, for instance.38 This structural difference should nonetheless
have very little impact on tear and puncture
properties, notably on anisotropy.

Blown Films

Figure 1 shows the through-view SAXS profiles
from the films of the three materials recorded
parallel to MD and TD. The nearly identical in-
tensity profiles of Figure 1(c) indicate a fairly
isotropic structure for M-LLDPE in the plane of
the film, which contrasts with the strong anisot-
ropy of the HP-LDPE film revealed in Figure 1(a).
Not only is the SAXS correlation peak much
higher along MD than along TD for HP-LDPE,
but the peak intensities are respectively greater
and smaller than those of the M-LLDPE SAXS
peak. This anisotropy of HP-LDPE is relevant to
the well-known flow-induced row texture of blown
films and spun fibers41 with the crystalline lamel-
lae essentially normal to MD. The ZN-LLDPE
film displays an intermediate state of orientation
[Fig. 1(b)] between HP-LDPE and M-LLDPE
films [Fig. 1(a,c)], the crystalline lamellae being
still preferentially normal to MD.

SAXS measurements from the edges of the
films corroborate the row texture of the HP-LDPE

film, as judged from Figure 2. As a matter of fact,
the edge-view profile recorded along MD shows a
much stronger intensity maximum than the one

along ND. This is clear evidence that most of the
crystalline lamellae lie normal to MD. It is quite
surprising that M-LLDPE also displays some an-
isotropy from the edge view of the film [Fig. 2(b)],
which suggests that the elongated crystalline la-
mellae, otherwise lamellar ribbons, have a pre-
dominant orientation along ND. Considering the
through-view isotropy of M-LLDPE [Fig. 1(c)], we
may ascribe this finding to a preferred orientation
of the growth direction of the lamellar ribbons,
namely, the crystallographic b axis,42 along the
temperature gradient43,44 during the crystalliza-
tion step, that is, the film thickness in this in-
stance. This effect should also exist for HP-LDPE
but is certainly hidden by the flow-induced row
texture. The M-LLDPE film may, therefore, be
called orthotropic rather than isotropic.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 331 The WAXS patterns of Figure 3 show a rein-
forcement of the inner (110) and outer (200) re-
flections in the MD and TD positions, respec-
tively, for HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films. This is
relevant to the so-called low-stress row structure
of Keller and Machin,41 which corresponds to a
preferred orientation of the twisted crystalline
lamellae with the crystallographic b axis, that is,
the growth axis, roughly parallel to TD, and the a
and c axes being randomly distributed about TD
because of the lamellar twisting. The diagonal
reinforcement of the (110) reflection for the HP-
LDPE film [Fig. 3(a)] reveals a sharper orienta-
tion of the b axis parallel to TD than for ZN-
LLDPE. The M-LLDPE film displays no preferred
orientation of the crystalline phase in the film,
indicating isotropy or orthotropy. These WAXS
data corroborate the conclusions from SAXS.

With respect to the compression-molded
sheets, the unreported WAXS patterns confirm
the completely isotropic structure for the three
materials.

UNIAXIAL TENSILE DRAWING

Compression-Molded Sheets

In conjunction with structural investigations,
several authors have used uniaxial tensile draw-
ing of blown films to understand the tear and
puncture behavior.10,20,24,30,31 Because the dart
test is equivalent to a multiaxial tensile test, it is
obvious that uniaxial testing at various orienta-
tions with respect to MD may be valuable for
understanding the puncture resistance of films.
In contrast, tensile drawing does not seem to have
significant relevance to tear resistance, at first
sight. Nevertheless, it clearly appears from the
literature data24,30 that the more unbalanced the
tear resistance is in MD and TD of blown films,
the greater the departure is of both the strain
hardening and the elongation at break of the films
upon tensile drawing along MD and TD.

The engineering stress–strain curves of the iso-
tropic compression-molded polymers are reported
in Figure 4. The three materials have about the
same yield stress at 10  1 MPa. However, HP-
LDPE displays a lower elongation at rupture and
a lower strain hardening than ZN-LLDPE. This
well-known phenomenon can be ascribed to the
bulkiness of the branched molecules with LCBs,
which limit chain overlapping in the melt. A re-

332 GUICHON ET AL.

sult of this phenomenon is to reduce the entan-
glement density and the intercrystalline tie chain
frequency in the crystallized material.38 This
point is more specifically addressed in the Discus-
sion section.

M-LLDPE displays a lower elongation at break
than ZN-LLDPE but exhibits a surprisingly
higher strain hardening. A similar observation in
a previous study40 has been ascribed to a higher
concentration of entanglements and tie chains in
M-LLDPE because of the homogeneous distribu-
tions of the counits, which not only reduces crys-
tal thickness in comparison with ZN-LLDPE (see
the previous section) but also reduces the pro-
cesses of regular folding and reeling-induced dis-
entanglement of the chains during crystalliza-
tion. Therefore, in contrast to HP-LDPE, which is
less resistant to tensile drawing than ZN-LLDPE
because of lower overlapping of the chains, M-
LLDPE looks significantly more resistant than
ZN-LLDPE because of better chain intertwining.

Blown Films

Figure 5 shows the tensile stress–strain curves
along MD and TD for the three types of films.
M-LLDPE displays quite similar behavior when
tested along MD and TD [Fig. 5(c)]. Besides, the
stress–strain curves resemble that of the isotropic
compression-molded sheet (Fig. 4), notably with
respect to extension at break and strain harden-
ing. This finding means that M-LLDPE is almost
isotropic and accounts for the well-equilibrated

TD and MD tear resistance. In contrast, HP-
LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films exhibit unbalanced
tensile properties along MD and TD [Fig. 5(a,b)],

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 333 notably a lower drawability along MD. Besides,
drawability in both directions is lower than that
of the compression-molded sheets, this phenome-
non being much more pronounced for HP-LDPE.
This means that both ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display a higher degree of chain extension in MD.
In parallel to its much reduced drawability in
MD, HP-LDPE displays a surprising jump of the
yield stress to about 15 MPa in MD, in contrast to
10 MPa in TD and for the isotropic sheet. This point
is specifically addressed in the Discussion section.

The nearly isotropic properties of the M-
LLDPE film suggest that the chains have an al-
most undisturbed coil conformation despite the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. In contrast,
the unbalanced properties of ZN-LLDPE and HP-
LDPE films, together with the significant loss of
drawability with respect to their isotropic com-
pression-molded counterparts, are relevant to a
significant chain extension in the films. This is
evidence that the flow-induced extension of the
chains during the blowing process has been partly
frozen-in during the solidification step, for both
HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE. This suggests that
these two materials have less capacity for chain
relaxation in the melt than M-LLDPE, HP-LDPE
being the most quenching-sensitive.

The strain hardening of M-LLDPE, both in
films and sheets, is somewhat higher than that of
the two other materials. Such a property notably
reduces the capacity for plastic instabilities dur-
ing deformation and, therefore, contributes to the
improvement of the puncture resistance of the
M-LLDPE film. As a corollary to its higher strain
hardening, the M-LLDPE film exhibits lower
standard deviations of the tear and puncture re-
sistance data (Table 2) that are relevant to a
weaker sensitivity to structural film defects such
as thickness fluctuations and inclusions.

DISCUSSION

Table 4 reports a summary of the film properties.
Both structural and mechanical anisotropy in-
crease in the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and
HP-LDPE. In comparison with the compression-
molded sheets, the tensile drawing of the films
clearly reveals that, despite the similar blowing
conditions, the three materials have different lev-
els of chain extension (otherwise chain unfolding)
depending on the chain architecture. The shrink-
age data of Table 4, which reflect the degree of
chain extension frozen in the films, thoroughly
support this conclusion. The material rankings
for the degree of chain extension of the films are
the same as the previous ones for the increasing
anisotropy. The different levels of chain extension
of the three materials, superimposed on the crys-
talline texturing, can be analyzed with regard to
the rheological properties of the materials, in re-
lation to the processing conditions.

Chain Relaxation during Blowing

The mean relaxation time data of Table 1 show
that the three materials have quite different ca-
pabilities of relaxation in the melt of the flow-
induced chain extension accompanying TUR  12and BUR  2.5. Considering the frost-line height
of about 50 cm and the take-up speed of 12 m/min
used in the blowing process, one may estimate
that the molten material experiences an exten-
sional flow for about 2.5 s before solidification.
The actual duration of the extensional flow is
certainly shorter than this figure because the
chain-extension pathway along TD and MD is not
uniform over the whole length between the die
and the frost line. Therefore, it is clear that the
relaxation time of HP-LDPE may hardly allow a

recovery of the flow-induced chain extension dur-
ing the time that elapses between extrusion and
crystallization. In contrast, ZN-LLDPE and M-
LLDPE are clearly capable of relaxing the flow-
induced chain extension, at least in part, before
crystallization.

Ghaneh-Fard et al.45 pointed out the role of
chain relaxation on the orientational behavior of
blown films in the melt before crystallization. Yu
and Wilkes22 emphasized the drastic effect of long
chains having a long relaxation time on film ori-
entation. Lu et al.30,31 demonstrated that the
shape of the incipient bubble, which is governed
by the cooling conditions, strongly influences the
film texture and properties because of the modi-
fications of the relaxation capabilities of the mol-
ten material along MD and TD. Prasad et al.46 also reported recently that LCBs in linear HDPE
induce a strong texturing of blown films because
of a drastic increase of the longest relaxation time
in the melt. In contrast, Plumbey et al.20 reported
a nearly isotropic structure for metallocene copol-
ymer films, despite unbalanced TUR and BUR
values. Recently, Legros et al.26 reported that
metallocene copolymers afford significantly less
oriented films than corresponding Ziegler–Natta
copolymers. These observations, which corrobo-
rate our own findings on the M-LLDPE film, can
unambiguously be ascribed to the rather short
relaxation time of metallocene copolymers, which
is due to the narrow MWD.

With respect to the shrinkage behavior, the
data reported in the last column of Table 4 show
that the three kinds of films systematically shrink
more along MD than along TD. However, these
data also display quite different shrinkage capa-
bilities of the films in the order HP-LDPE  ZN-
LLDPE  M-LLDPE. The very low shrinkage of
the M-LLDPE film is notably indicative of a very
faint chain extension. This finding thoroughly
agrees with the MD and TD tensile drawing be-
havior of the M-LLDPE film, which closely resem-
bles that of the compression-molded sheet. There-
fore, the so-called orthotropy of the M-LLDPE
film, which has been concluded from the stand-
point of texture, turns out to be very close to
isotropy from a mechanical standpoint.

ZN-LLDPE is slightly unbalanced with respect
to the stress–strain curves in TD and MD [Fig.
5(b)], and the curves are not so far from the one of
the isotropic sheet (Fig. 4). In contrast, HP-LDPE
is highly unbalanced, and the stress–strain
curves reveal higher drawability along TD. Be-

sides, HP-LDPE displays significantly lower
strain hardening and lower stress at break than
ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE. The strong mechani-
cal anisotropy and poor performances at rupture
provide an explanation for the relatively poor dart
impact resistance of the HP-LDPE film.

The contrasting behaviors of HP-LDPE and
ZN-LLDPE with respect to tearing, that is, the
higher tear resistance being along MD and TD,
respectively, suggest a competition between crys-
tal orientation and chain extension in the process
of crack propagation, which is discussed later.

The quite different degrees of texturing of the
three kinds of materials, which greatly influence
their tensile drawing behavior and use properties,
can be explained by the rheology of the materials:
the much shorter relaxation time of M-LLDPE in
the melt allows an almost complete relaxation of
the flow-extended chains toward the stable ran-
dom coil conformation, during the time elapsing
between the die and the frost line. ZN-LLDPE
and HP-LDPE are only partly able to relax the
chain extension before crystallization, the latter
having greater hindrance for chain relaxation.

Chain Intertwining

The entanglement of chains has a tremendous
effect on both rheological and solid state prop-
erties. It strongly contributes to the strain-
hardening effect in the elongational viscosity,
which is a basic factor of bubble stability during
tubular film blowing.47 It is also a determining
factor for the mechanical properties of blown
films via drawability and strain hardening.
However, it is noteworthy that branched and
linear PEs display a puzzling opposite behavior
with respect to this latter property: namely, the
strain hardening of melt elongational viscosity
is high for branched PEs and low for linear
PEs,47 whereas just the opposite trend is ob-
served for the solid materials.38 This phenomenon emphasizes the drastic in-
fluence of molecular dynamics on chain extension
in the melt, which contrasts with the predomi-
nance of structural factors such as the entangle-
ment density on chain extension in the solid state.
Indeed, in the case of elongational flow experi-
ments,47 the strain hardening of branched PEs,
which is relevant to chain extension, can be re-
duced to about nothing if the timescale of the
experiments is comparable or greater than the
relaxation time. This is a clear indication of the

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 335 transient character of the chain network in the
melt, which may disentangle under extensional
flow at a low strain rate. For linear PEs, no strain
hardening of the elongational viscosity suggests a
high capacity for chain disentanglement during
extensional flow. In the solid state, chain exten-
sion is governed by the entanglement density,
which determines the strain hardening.48 The
lower strain hardening of branched PEs may be
ascribed to a low entanglement density.

The ability of polymer chains for intertwining
in the melt is mainly connected to the chain flex-
ibility, which is explained by the so-called C

parameter. Besides this parameter, the overlap-
ping capability of the chain coils of a given poly-
mer species, such as PE in this instance, is highly
sensitive to the molecular architecture of the
chains. If we neglect thermal expansion effects,
the degree of chain overlap in the melt can be
defined as the ratio

X  /app (1) of the actual density of molten PE,   0.85 g/cm3,to the apparent density of the chain coils, app.
Indeed, if we consider an isolated chain of molar
weight M, the X parameter provides an estima-
tion of the number of parent chains of the same
molar weight that must intertwine within the
volume embraced by the isolated chain in a ran-
dom coil conformation to achieve the actual den-
sity of the molten polymer. The apparent density
of the isolated chain can be estimated from the
ratio of the molar weight to the volume of the
sphere of radius equal to the radius of gyration of
the random coil, Rg, because this sphere enfolds
more than 90% of the segments of the chain coil.49 For linear PE and ethylene copolymers, one may
consider the following relationship established
from literature data:50 Rg  1.26M1⁄2 (2) where Rg is given in nanometers and M is given in
kilodaltons. Now, if we consider a linear low-den-
sity polyethylene (LLDPE) chain with M  100kDa, that is, about the weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) for the polymers investigated in this
work, it turns out that Rg is approximately 12.6nm, and the apparent density is app  0.02 g/cm3.Borrowing from Kuhn and Kromer’s32 study of
the molecular architecture of HP-LDPE, we have

sketched Figure 6 a chain of molar weight M
 100 kDa of the single-autoclave HP-LDPE in a
branch-extended conformation. The HP-LDPE
molecule notably exhibits 10 LCBs with an aver-
age molar weight between LCBs close to 6 kDa.
One may estimate to about 42 kDa the molar
weight of its main chain, which is shown as a bold
line in Figure 6. Assuming, in the first approxi-
mation, that LCBs do not significantly change the
chain conformation in the melt, one may estimate
the radius of gyration of the HP-LDPE chain coil,
Rg  8.0 nm, from the length of its main chain
with eq 2. The apparent density of the HP-LDPE
chain coil is, therefore, app  0.08 g/cm3. Despite numerous assumptions, the aforemen-
tioned apparent density data reveal that the
chains are deeply interpenetrated in the molten
materials: for a chain of molar weight M  100kDa, the degree of chain overlap is X  50 for
LLDPE and X  12 for HP-LDPE. Besides, these
data show that chain overlap is much greater for
LLDPE than for HP-LDPE.

This finding suggests that interchain entangle-
ments, which provide the strength of the molecu-
lar network in the melt and in the solid state, are
significantly more numerous in linear chains
than in branched chains. Indeed, reduced over-
lapping reduces the probability of neighboring
chains intertwining with each other. This has
already been claimed to be an explanation for the

Figure 6. Schematic drawing for the molecular archi-
tecture of an HP-LDPE branched chain with a molar
weight of 100 kDa.

higher strain hardening of linear PEs in the solid
state.38 Of course, LCBs can make entanglements
among themselves, within the sphere of gyration
of the coil, but these intramolecular entangle-
ments only contribute to the coil stiffness instead
of the network strength. However, as previously
pointed out, the strain hardening in the melt is
lower for linear PEs than for branched PEs. This
phenomenon, apparently contradicting the higher
entanglement density of linear PEs, can be ex-
plained by dynamic effects during the extensional
flow in the melt,47,51 namely, a lower resistance to
either disentanglement or strain-induced orienta-
tion of linear chains in comparison with branched
chains. The longer relaxation time in the melt of
branched PEs (see Table 1) supports this proposal
of reduced chain dynamics due to LCBs.

Chain Unfolding versus Chain and/or Lamellar
Orientation

Several authors have recently suggested that the
orientation of lamellar stacks in blown films is
responsible for unbalanced properties,24,29–31 in
contrast with most authors, who incriminate mo-
lecular orientation. Lu et al.30,31 notably showed
that processing conditions that promote randomly
oriented lamellar stacks reduce mechanical an-
isotropy and improve dart impact resistance. Our
data on M-LLDPE thoroughly support this find-
ing. However, because ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display the same type of texture, with the lamel-
lae preferentially oriented normal to MD, the re-
verse trend of the two types of films with respect
to MD and TD tear resistance reveal that the real
situation is somewhat more complex than that
previously described. We suggest that, beyond la-
mellar and chain orientations, chain unfolding is
a factor of prime importance.

It is quite obvious that the unfolding of the
chains during the blowing process increases the
density of chain segments lying in the plane of the
film. If one intuitively considers that tear resis-
tance is governed by the frequency of such chain
segments that oppose themselves to the propaga-
tion of the crack, one should expect an improve-
ment of tear resistance with increasing chain ex-
tension. The drawability and shrinkage data from
Table 1 clearly show that the ZN-LLDPE film has
preferred chain extension along MD, and this
means that more chain segments will bar the way
to the crack propagation along TD in comparison

with MD. This is why ZN-LLDPE has greater tear
resistance in TD than in MD.

Regarding the HP-LDPE film, both drawability
and shrinkage show that there is a high degree of
chain extension along MD and moderate chain
extension along TD, the latter being significantly
higher than that for ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE.
An explanation for this is that the branches of the
star-shaped macromolecules are unfolded in the
two main directions during the blowing process,
and only a part of this unfolding can be relaxed
before crystallization because of the rather high
relaxation time. The chain extension that is fro-
zen in the film is greater along MD because of the
higher value of TUR with respect to BUR. In
addition, because the chains are not ideally
spherical but consist of a main chain with lateral
LCBs, as sketched in Figure 6, this main chain is
likely to preferentially unfold along MD during
the blowing process because TUR  BUR and also
because of a suspected much longer relaxation
time of the main chain in comparison with that of
the LCBs. Consequently, the LCBs should act as
molecular arms, slightly extended in TD, all along
the main chain. If this is the case, a propagating
crack would cross more chain segments in MD
than in TD. This provides an explanation for the
greater tear resistance of HP-LDPE in MD than
in TD, that is, a reverse behavior of that of ZN-
LLDPE. Nevertheless, the overall higher level of
tear resistance of the latter can be explained by
the higher degree of chain overlapping of ZN-
LLDPE, which involves a higher degree of chain
entanglement and, therefore, a higher mechani-
cal strength of the macromolecular network.

The fact that the M-LLDPE film is challenged
by the ZN-LLDPE film with respect to the level of
the tear resistance in both MD and TD, despite its
well-equilibrated tear behavior and better punc-
ture resistance, deserves special attention. The
explanation is straightforward in consideration of
our previous argument on the density of chain
segments that can act as obstacles to the propa-
gation of the crack during the tear test. Indeed,
the nearly isotropic M-LLDPE film necessarily
contains fewer chain segments oriented parallel
to the film plane than the ZN-LLDPE film to
make opposition to either MD or TD tear. It is,
therefore, suggested that isotropy is beneficial for
puncture resistance because of the high drawabil-
ity afforded by the chain in a random coil confor-
mation, but this is not favorable for optimum tear
resistance, despite good balance.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 337 Finally, a last comment should be made re-
garding the shape of the stress–strain curve along
MD of the HP-LDPE film, the yield stress being
50% higher than that along TD, as well as that of
the isotropic material. This phenomenon has been
reported previously for branched PEs38 but never
for linear PEs. This cannot be explained solely by
the high degree of chain extension along MD. We
suspect that the strong orientation of the crystal-
line lamellae with their normal along MD, as
judged from SAXS [Fig. 1(a)], prevents the plastic
shear processes through both the sample width
and thickness of the film because the resolved
shear stress (RSS) on the (hk0) slip planes is nil.
Plasticity may only take place after some tilt of
the lamellae to orient the slip planes toward the
maximum RSS. Rotation about the b axis is by far
the most easy tilt process because of the rather
large form factor of the lamellae. However, the
high degree of chain extension along MD, already
discussed, is likely to hinder the lamellar tilting
as the applied tensile stress increases. The criti-
cal RSS in the crystalline lamellae will then be
reached after the applied tensile stress has
jumped much above the value required for yield-
ing for the corresponding isotropic sample.

Isotropy versus Orthotropy

ZN-LLDPE exhibits better tear resistance than
M-LLDPE, despite its anisotropy. In contrast, iso-
tropic M-LLDPE has a better puncture resistance
because of high drawability with high energy ab-
sorption. Therefore, if the chain extension that
takes place during blowing involves an increase
in the chain segment density within the film
plane that is beneficial for tear resistance, it is
quite clear that isotropy is beneficial for puncture
resistance. One may, nevertheless, wonder if or-
thotropy, involving equilibrated chain extension
along MD and TD, would not be the best way for
optimum puncture and tear resistance, with a fair
balance of the latter along MD and TD.

Metallocene PEs have short relaxation times in
the melt that make them able to recover most of
the chain extension developed during the time of
the blowing before crystallization. This is the rea-
son for the fair isotropy of the films, which ac-
counts for the mechanical properties. Linear PEs
can also be blown into nearly isotropic films, but
the reasons are quite different. TUR and BUR are
generally the major factors of film texturing. The
common situation, with TUR greater than BUR,

leads to the row structure with the crystalline
lamellae normal to MD. Reducing the TUR/BUR
ratio provides a means of reducing the structural
anisotropy and improving in parallel both the
puncture resistance and tear resistance bal-
ance.18,25,29–31 Unfortunately, this situation is too
far from industrial conditions of film blowing.
However, the deformation path of the molten ma-
terial during tubular blowing is strongly depen-
dant on the processing parameters, such as the
stress, air velocity, and freeze-line height. Those
parameters may be adjusted for re-equilibrating
the difference of chain extension induced by the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. The deforma-
tion path can notably be modified by changes in
the freeze-line height.28,30,31,52,53 Therefore, the
shape of the bubble in the deformation zone be-
tween the die and the crystallization line may
have the form of either a bowl or a stemmed
glass,52 depending on whether film stretching
along MD and TD takes place in a simultaneous
or sequential manner, respectively. This involves
a modification of the molecular extension pro-
cesses and notably enables a more important re-
laxation-induced rearrangement of the chains in
the direction in which chain extension occurred
first.30,31,53 This was the way used by Lu et al.31 to
reverse the MD-to-TD tear resistance ratio for
HDPE films for the same TUR/BUR ratio of ap-
proximately 8. Despite this high TUR/BUR ratio,
the authors showed that increasing the time al-
lowed for MD chain relaxation involved a higher
level of TD chain extension in comparison with
MD, as revealed by the MD and TD tensile draw-
ing curves.31 This resulted in an unusual greater
tear resistance for linear PE in MD than in TD.

Some authors have claimed that isotropy is
favorable for film use properties.10,18,19 However,
it seems that the so-called isotropy of the films,
judged either from two-dimensional structural
studies in the plane of the film or from the com-
parison of MD and TD mechanical properties,
might be, in fact, an orthotropy. Only metallocene
PEs really display isotropy, regardless of blowing
conditions, because of relaxation times much
shorter than those for conventional linear or
branched LDPE at an equivalent melt-flow index
(MFI).

CONCLUSIONS

The tear and puncture resistance of films largely
depend on the processing-induced texture. M-

338 GUICHON ET AL.

LLDPE has a very short relaxation time in the
melt in comparison with the time that the mate-
rial remains in the molten state between the die
and the frost line. This enables the chains
stretched by the blow-up and take-up to relax to a
nearly isotropic state. This almost annihilates
film texturing and imparts better dart impact
performances in comparison with those of ZN-
LLDPE and HP-LDPE. The slightly higher strain
hardening of M-LLDPE, which is ascribed to a
very small number of LCBs, also contributes to its
high puncture resistance.

The better use properties of ZN-LLDPE in com-
parison with those of HP-LDPE are assigned to
better chain intertwining and higher strain hard-
ening in the solid state. The opposite behavior of
the two materials with respect to the unbalanced
tear resistance of the films is ascribed to the chain
architecture: linear chains mainly unfold along
MD for ZN-LLDPE, whereas chains with LCBs
unfold along both MD and TD for HP-LDPE.

Even though M-LLDPE provides the best com-
promise of maximum puncture resistance and
quite high and well-equilibrated tear resistance,
it is not as good as ZN-LLDPE with respect to the
tear resistance level. This is attributed to the
nearly isotropic structure with an almost random
chain distribution, which reduces the probability
of chain segments lying within the film plane.
These segments are the ones most prone to stop
crack propagation. It is, therefore, suggested that
orthotropy, with some degree of chain extension
within the film plane, would be the better texture
for optimized tear and puncture resistance for
either ZN-LLDPE or M-LLDPE. HP-LDPE will
never reach equivalent use properties because it
lacks strain hardening.

The generalization of our conclusions to all
kinds of PEs produced by similar polymerization
methods cannot be made without precautions.
However, a general conclusion is that the average
relaxation time in the melt is a major factor for
the development of texture and mechanical an-
isotropy. This may help us to understand some of
the specific properties reported in the literature,
notably in consideration of the time allowed to the
various sequences of the blowing process. The
knowledge of a whole distribution of relaxation
times, in combination with a complete molecular
characterization, would be a promising way to
progress into the structure–property relation-
ships of PE films.

Available online 12 July 2005 Abstract

Three nearly identical linear low density polyethylene resins based on copolymers of ethylene with 1-butene (B), 1-hexene (H) and

1-octene (O) were utilized to investigate the effect of short chain branch length on the mechanical properties of blown and compression

molded (quenched and slow cooled) films. The content of short chain comononer in the three copolymers was ca. 2.5–2.9 mol% that

corresponded to a density of 0.917–0.918 g/cm3. Within a given series, the tensile properties of these films do not show any significant

difference at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min), even though the DSC and TREF profiles of ‘H’ and ‘O’ differed slightly in

comparison to ‘B’. However, at higher deformation rates (ca. 1 m/s), the breaking strength of these films was found to increase with

increasing short chain branch length. In addition, the Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength of the blown films were also observed to

increase with increasing short chain branch length. Further, dart impact strength and high-speed puncture resistance (5.1 m/s) of 1-octene and

1-hexene based samples was also observed to be higher than that based on 1-butene. The blown films displayed low and comparable levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and crystalline orientation by wide angle X-ray scattering. This confirms that the differences in mechanical

properties in the blown film series are not attributable to differences in molecular orientation. The deformation behavior of both the

compression molded and blown films were also investigated in a well-defined controlled regime by analyzing their essential work of fracture.

It was found that the essential work of fracture of films based on 1-hexene and 1-octene was higher than that of films based on 1-butene. While

the origin of these differences in mechanical properties with increasing short chain branch length is not fully understood, the present

investigation confirms this effect to be pronounced at high deformation rates for both the blown and compression molded quenched films.

the copolymerization of ethylene and an a-olefin, such as

1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, etc. The

a-olefin, present in small amounts in the copolymer,

introduces short chain branches (SCB) on the polymer

backbone; for instance, the three particularly common

comonomers, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene addressed in

this report introduce ethyl, butyl and hexyl branches,

respectively. The primary objective of this study is to

investigate whether the length of the short chain branch

(2.5–2.9 mol%, at a copolymer density of ca. 0.917– 0.918 g/cm3) affects the mechanical properties of LLDPE

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378820films. As will be reviewed below, many studies have

attempted to address this same topic but in doing so, many

important and influential parameterswere not necessarily well

controlled in the respective investigations. We believe the

present report has improved on this aspect aswill be discussed.

LLDPE resins are typically produced using Ziegler Natta

heterogeneous catalysts, whose origins can be traced back to

the late 1950s [1]. However, the resins produced by these

catalysts are characterized by considerable heterogeneity in

their microstructure and melting behavior and are con-

sidered to be a mixture of fractions of polyethylene

copolymers with a range of molecular weights and short

chain branch content. In the mid 1990s, with the commercial

advent of high efficiency single site metallocene catalysts,

narrow molecular weight distribution LLDPEs with con-

siderably more homogenous distribution of short chain

branches were produced. Metallocene-based LLDPE resins

have now been commercialized using various different

catalyst technologies [2–6]. The single site metallocene

catalysts produce copolymers that have much narrower

molecular weight distributions (ca. 2–3) and a greater

uniformity in the distribution of the short chain branching

across the width of the molecular weight distribution

relative to the Ziegler Natta catalyzed systems.

LLDPE resins of all types constitute a major segment of

the polyethylene (PE) blown film market worldwide. It is

known that the mechanical properties of the LLDPE films

are influenced by molecular structural parameters such as

molecular weight, molecular weight distribution in addition

to the amount as well as the short chain branch distribution

(SCBD) across the width of the copolymer molecular

weight distribution. Morphological features such as degree

of crystallinity, intercrystalline connectivity and preferred

orientation are also strongly believed to have an effect of the

mechanical properties of blown LLDPE films [7–19].

Short chain branching critically affects the crystallinity

and thus the morphology and consequently the solid-state

properties of the corresponding LLDPE films. As a result, a

broad range of properties of LLDPEs can be obtained by

varying the amount of SCB and the SCBD. In addition, the

length of the short chain branch may also play an important

role in governing the mechanical properties—the specific

issue that will be addressed in this study. Early on, Cady

[20] investigated the effects of the type of short chain

branching (SCB) and SCBD on the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strength of blown films of LLDPEs based

on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene that were synthesized

using Zeigler Natta catalyst chemistry. For similar density

and melt flow index, the 1-butene based resins performed

poorly in comparison to those based on 1-hexene and

1-octene, even though it had a more homogenous SCBD.

However, comparison of two different 1-octene based resins

that differed in their SCBD indicated better mechanical

performance for the 1-octene based resin that had a more

homogenous SCBD. No comment was made on the relative

amounts of the short chain branching in each of the resins, %

crystallinity or orientation of the blown films. However, it

was concluded that the combination of the short chain

branch length and a more homogenous SCBD leads to better

mechanical properties of LLDPE blown films. In a similar

study utilizing LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene that had densities in the range of 0.919– 0.921 g/cm3, melt flow indices of 0.9–1 dg/min and

polydispersities of 3.3–4.1, Liu and Baker [21] observed

the impact strength to increase with increasing short chain

branch length. It was suggested that the longer short chain

branches lead to a larger fraction of tie molecules in the

interlamellar region that causes the observed increase in

impact strength. However, in this study as well, both the

comonomer content and the SCBD varied simultaneously,

thereby making the interpretation of the corresponding

effects uncertain. In a third study, Kim and Park [22] observed

a similar trend for Zeigler-Natta catalyzed 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene based LLDPE blown films that had relatively

larger polydispersities (w6), varying comonomer compo-

sition (4.3, 3.7 and 2.8 mol% of 1-butene, 1-hexene and

1-octene, respectively) and varying branch density (21, 17 and

13 CH3/1000 C for 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene based

resins, respectively). The differences in the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strengths of the blown films based on the three

resins were attributed to the differences in short chain

branching distributions and increased imperfections in the

crystallographic order and decreased lamellar thickness

with increasing short chain branch length.

Wolfe [23] studied the effect of comonomer type on the

slow crack growth resistance of high-density polyethylene

using the PENT (ASTM F1473) test. Of the two

comonomers investigated (‘B’ and ‘H’), the HDPE based

on 1-hexene failed after 400 h compared to 30 h in the case

of HDPE based on 1-butene. No comment, however, was

made on the molecular weight, distribution of the short

chain branches and orientation of molecular chains in the

pipe resins utilized.

By investigating LLDPE resins based on 1-butene and

1-octene, Kale et al. [24] compared the intrinsic tear

strengths for two sets of resins (each set had two resins

based each on 1-butene and 1-octene) of densities 0.912 and

0.921 g/cm3, respectively. The resins had similar poly-

dispersities (2.12–2.25), melt flow indices (0.93–1.02) but

different short chain branch comonomer content. For the

0.912 g/cm3 set of resins, the mol% of 1-butene was 4.17 and that of 1-octene was 3.04; for the 0.921 g/cm3 set of

resins, these were 3.04 and 1.77 mol%, respectively, for

1-butene and 1-octene. Despite the differences in their

comonomer content and the lack of information on the

SCBD, the higher intrinsic tear strength of the 1-octene

based LLDPE resins relative to the 1-butene based resins

was speculated to be due to enhanced tie molecule

formation with increasing short chain branch length.

Further, the observed difference in the melting point versus

mole fraction comonomer relationships for 1-butene and

1-octene based LLDPE resins was suggested to be due to the












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8821incorporation of small amounts of 1-butene into the

crystalline phase and/or variations in the commoner

sequence distributions. However, Alizadeh et al. [25] and

Alamo et al. [26] have shown that the melting point

depression with increasing mole fraction of the short chain

branch comonomer is independent of the type of the

comonomer, i.e. at any given mole fraction of 1-butene,

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene in metallocene catalyzed

copolymers with polyethylene, the melting point depression

of all these copolymers was observed to be comparable.

Further, Alizadeh et al. [25] observed that at any given

mol% of the short chain branch comonomer, the degree of

crystallinity was also very comparable for LLDPE based on

1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. These obser-

vations clearly suggest that the degree/probability of branch

exclusion from the lamellar crystal is independent of the

comonomer type, viz. 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Therefore, in turn, one would expect no differences in tie

molecule formation for the three LLDPE materials based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Kennedy et al. [27] also studied the tensile stress–strain

behavior of metallocene catalyzed LLDPE resins based on

1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-methyl-1-pentene. It

was observed that the nominal-stress strain curves, that were

measured at low deformation rate of 0.0004 m/s (1 in./min)

compared to high deformation rates involved during the

impact (0.2–4 m/s) and Elmendorf tear testing (0.1–7 m/s),

were dominated by strain hardening for all the LLDPEs

resins excepting those based on 1-butene. The yield stress

and initial modulus were related to the degree of crystal-

linity regardless of the short chain branch comonomer.

More importantly, for the highest molecular weights studied

(MwO100,000 g/mol) the force-elongation curves

(recorded at low deformation rates of 0.0004 m/s) for the

four resins were observed to be similar to one another for the

same short chain branch content. This last observation is

important for until the present report, the tensile stress strain

behavior of LLDPE resins, particularly based on 1-butene,

1-hexene or 1-octene, have not been systematically studied

at high deformation rates similar to those involved in dart or

Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength testing. In

addition, the dart or Spencer impact strength and Elmendorf

tear resistance measurements, although standard ASTM

measurements in industry are characterized by non-uniform

deformation rates.

It is important to note that most of the studies that relate

to the influence exerted by the branch length involve

comparisons of LLDPE films from resins that either have

different short chain branch contents, different comonomer

distribution profile (SCBD), different polydispersities or

different short chain branch density on the main ethylene

backbone. As a result, it is extremely difficult to properly

interpret the results and separate the effects of the individual

parameters (mentioned above) on the physical properties of

LLDPE resins due to their simultaneous variation. Thus, in

this study, three LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene, that have been carefully synthesized [28] using the same single site metallocene based catalyst, were

examined to specifically investigate the effect of the

comonomer type (short chain branch length), viz.

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene on the mechanical proper-

ties of blown and compression molded LLDPE films. As

will be discussed later, these three resins were very

comparable in terms of their molecular, rheological,

comonomer content and SCBD aspects. As a result, any

differences arising out of structural differences from other

origins, while not fully eliminated, were minimized. Results

from the earlier study [28] showed that while the tensile

properties, at nominal deformation rates, of the blown films

were indistinguishable, the Elmendorf tear, dart impact and

Spencer impact properties of the 1-butene based films were

significantly lower than the corresponding 1-hexene and

1-octene based films. The difference between 1-hexene and

1-octene films was much smaller with a slight advantage for

the 1-octene films. In this study, we attempt to further

investigate the effect of the type of the short chain branch on

the mechanical properties of LLDPE films since other

parameters (like comonomer content, SCBD, molecular

weight, molecular weight distribution, polydispersity and

density) were established to be essentially constant [28].

The mechanical properties were measured utilizing Spencer

impact, Elmendorf tear resistance and high-speed puncture

resistance measurements as well as in a controlled tensile

deformation regime by utilizing the essential work of

fracture methodology/technique.

2. Essential work of fracture (EWF)

Recent studies have indicated that the EWF procedure is

a very useful method to study the fracture properties of thin

films and ductile materials [29–33]. The concept of EWF

was developed initially by Cotterell and Reddel [34] on the

basis of ideas proposed by Broberg [35], who suggested that

the total work of fracture (Wf) dissipated in a precracked

specimen could be represented as a sum of the work

consumed into two distinct zones. As shown in Fig. 1, the

double-edge-notched-tension (DENT) specimen that is

precracked along the horizontal (inwards from the vertical

edges) to leave a ligament region ‘l’ that undergoes the actual

deformation in tension under a load ‘F’ along the vertical.

The regions marked as ‘1’ and ‘2’ depict the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and the outer plastic zone, respectively, (OPZ).

The work dissipated in the FPZ corresponds to the

essential work of fracture (We); and the work required to

yield the material in the OPZ is the non-essential work of

fracture (Wp) that depends on the geometry of the specimen

tested. Thus, the total fracture energy is expressed as (more

details are provided elsewhere [34]):

(DENT) mode. The zones marked with 1 and 2 indicate the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and outer plastic zone (OPZ), respectively. The ligament length

(denoted as ‘l’) in the present study was 1, 2 or 3 mm.

ligament area), wp is the specific non-essential work of

fracture (per unit volume), l is the ligament length, t is the

specimen thickness and b is the plastic zone shape factor.

The total specific work of fracture is represented by:

wf Z
Wf

lt
Zwe Cbwpl (2) From Eq. (2), it is clear that wf has a linear relationship with

the ligament length. In other words, a plot of the wf as a

function of l should be linear with the intercept on the

ordinate axis and the slope providing we and bwp,

respectively. Thus, this method involves testing of speci-

mens that have different ligament lengths, and then

evaluating the Wf for each specimen (area under the

force–displacement curve) followed by suitable normal-

ization with respect to the ligament area to give a plot of wf

vs. l. The best-fit regression line would then give the slope

(bwp) and intercept (we).

When plane stress conditions prevail for all ligament

lengths, it is assumed [36] that we is a material property (a

constant) at a given thickness. Mathematically, for plane

stress conditions, the following two relationships should be

satisfied:

(4)

Under these conditions, it has been demonstrated theoreti-

cally [37] and supported experimentally [37–39] that we is

equivalent to Jc, or the J-integral. For a nonlinear elastic

body containing a precrack and undergoing deformation, Jc
represents the strain energy release rate of nonlinear elastic

materials and is given by: [40] JC ZK
dU

dA
(5)

where U is the potential energy (also the difference between

the strain energy stored in the body and the work done by

external forces of deformation) and A is the crack area. It

can be seen that the units of Jc are also energy/area (the

same as we). Thus, the advantage of the EWF method is its

experimental simplicity as compared to the J-integral

procedure.

3. Experimental

3.1. Material synthesis

The three LLDPE copolymers (based on ethylene-co-1- butene, ‘B’, ethylene-co-1-hexene, ‘H’, and ethylene-co-1- octene, ‘O’) used in this study were synthesized by using a

Chevron Phillips’ proprietary zirconium based metallocene

catalyst [28]. The copolymerization was conducted in a pilot

plant at Chevron Phillips under steady state slurry-loop

copolymerization conditions. The comonomers and the

catalyst were fed continuously and the polymer fluff was

continuously removed from the reactor. The fluff was

purged with nitrogen to remove residual solvent and

unreacted olefins followed by blending with antioxidants

and a processing aid. The polymers were then extruded into

pellets.

3.2. Characterization of the resins

The molecular, rheological and branching characteristics

of the three resins are listed in Table 1. The rheological data

were obtained using a Rheometrics Scientific Inc., ARES

rheometer. Small strain (10%) oscillatory measurements

across a frequency range of 0.03–95 rad/s were made at

190 8C under a nitrogen blanket. The resulting complex

viscosity versus frequency data was fitted using the modi-

fied Carreau–Yasuda (CY) empirical model [41,42] to

obtain the zero shear viscosity (h0). The molecular weight,










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8823and the molecular weight distribution were determined by

gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Nuclear magnetic

resonance (NMR) was utilized to determine the amount of

comonomer and thus the short chain branching incorporated

into the respective copolymers. The experimental proce-

dures of these two techniques are outlined in detail else-

where [43]. In addition, the comonomer composition

distribution across the molecular weight distribution of

these three copolymers was determined by a recently deve-

loped chemometric technique [44] based on size exclusion

chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectros-

copy (SEC–FTIR).

Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) was

performed on the three resins to determine the homogeneity

of incorporation of SCB in the copolymers. This was done

by using a triple detector TREF instrument which was

assembled using parts retro-fitted into a Waters 150C GPC

system. The column (12.55 mm ID and 150 mm in length)

was packed with #30 stainless steel shot (Vulcan Blast Shot

Technology, Brantfor, Ont., Canada). The oven heater pro-

vided programmed cooling and heating in the 35–150 8C range. It was controlled externally via West 4400 set point

programmer. Three detectors, viz. a Foxboro infrared (IR)

(3.4 nm), a Viscotek 150R viscometer and a PDI 15 and

90-degree dual-angle light scattering detector, were utilized

for characterization. The viscometer and the light scattering

detector were housed in the same oven while the IR cell was

heated separately. Sample solutions were prepared in the

carrier solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), at 3 mg/mL.

In the experiment, 500 mL of the sample solution was

injected onto the column at 150 8C and subsequently cooled

to 35 8C at a rate of 0.72 8C/min, to allow slow and complete

crystallization. The column was then slowly re-heated to

150 8C at a rate of 1.5 8C/min with a solvent flow rate

of 0.5 mL/min, during which the polymer molecules

re-dissolved and eluted out into the three detectors. Analysis

of the data obtained from the IR detector was done to get

normalized weight fraction of the fractionated copolymer as

a function of the temperature.

3.3. Film preparation

Blown films were made from each of the three resins

under the following conditions: 100 mm (4 in.) die diameter,

1.5 mm die gap, 37.5 mm diameter single-screw extruder

(L/DZ24, compression ratio 2.2:1), 115 rpm screw speed (ca.

27 kg/h output rate), 2.5:1 blow up ratio (BUR) and barrel and

die temperatures set to 190 8C. The freeze line height (FLH)

was between 20 and 28 cm and cooling was accomplished

with a dual lip air ring using ambient air that had a temperature

of ca. 20 8C. Films with different thicknesses (12.5–100 mm
or 0.5–4 mil) were produced this way. These conditions are

representative of typical commercial scale LLDPE blown

film processing according to scaling procedures established

previously [45].

In addition to these blown films, unoriented quenched

and slow cooled compression molded films were also pro-

duced. Preweighed amounts of the copolymer pellets were

melted in a mold at 150 8C for 10 min followed by the

application of 3000 lb f (ca. 1350 kg f) for 5 min. Quenched

(Q) samples were prepared by being removed from the

heater plates followed by being placed on a wooden labora-

tory bench and exposed to ambient conditions. The samples

took ca. 5 min to cool to ambient temperature (ca. 20 8C).

For the slow cooled (SC) samples, the mold containing the

molten film was allowed to remain between the heater plates

after the pressure was released. The power to the heater

plates was then turned off to allow slow cooling of the films.

The samples attained room temperature in ca. 8 h. Both the

Q and SC films were ca. 125 mm (5 mil) in thickness.

3.4. Film characterization

The blown films of different thicknesses were tested for

their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and

Elmendorf tear resistance according to ASTM D-1709 (method A), ASTM D-3420 (although a special in-house

pendulum was utilized to ensure failures) and ASTM

D-1922 standards, respectively, at ambient conditions. In

addition, high-speed puncture resistance of the LLDPE

copolymers, at a high impact velocity (5.1 m/s), was also

investigated. For this test, quenched compression molded

and slow cooled plaques of approximately 3.35 mm

thickness were employed. The compression molded speci-

mens (corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) were clamped in a

circular fixture that is 76 mm in diameter. A 23.76 kg mass

tup/dart (13 mm diameter hemispherical end) was dropped

on the clamped specimens at an impact velocity of 5.1 m/s

(corresponding to a drop height of 1 m). The direction of

impact was parallel to the specimen thickness, and the point

of impact was at the center of the clamped specimen. The

tup/dart was equipped with a load sensor to measure the load

response as a function of time, during the impact event. A

separate photo sensor provided a measurement of the initial

impact velocity. At a given weight of the tup/dart assembly

and its impact velocity, the specimen load-deflection data

for the impact event was recorded. Total energy (J) to

rupture as measured from the load-deflection curve was

used to characterize the impact performance. The quantities

(energy to rupture) measured from this test are not fixed

material properties as they depend on the test specimen size

(thickness) and the specific test conditions.

Blown films that were 25 mm in thickness (each from

resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) in

addition to the compression molded films were chosen for

the rest of the characterization methods utilized including

refractive index measurements, differential scanning calori-

metry (DSC) and essential work of fracture analysis. Flat

plate wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of the

blown films were obtained at ambient conditions using a

Philips PW1720 X-ray generator. Four layers of each of

the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown film (based on 1-butene,












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–883788241-hexene and 1-octene) were carefully aligned and stacked

on the sample holder to obtain sufficient scattering intensity

for exposure of the WAXS pattern at 40 kV, 20 mA and 4 h.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 5 cm. The X-ray

beam was parallel to the normal of the sample plane.

Pin-hole collimated small-angle X-ray scattering

(SAXS) profiles of compression molded films were

collected at ambient temperature using a Rigaku Ultrax18 rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and

60 mA. A pyrolytic graphite monochromator was used to

filter out all radiation except the Cu Ka doublet, with an

average wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The camera used 200, 100 and 300 nm pinholes for X-ray collimation. Two-dimen-

sional data sets were collected using a molecular metrology

2D multi-wire area detector, located ca. 65 cm from the

sample. After azimuthal averaging, the raw data was

corrected for detector noise, absorption, and background

noise. The data were then placed on an absolute scale using

a type 2 glassy carbon sample 1.07 mm thickness,

previously calibrated at the advanced photon source at the

Argonne National Laboratory, as a secondary standard. All

the SAXS profiles presented have been masked in the low

scattering vector region where the beam stop influenced the

profiles.

Refractive index measurements were conducted at

ambient conditions on all the compression molded films

and the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films using a Metricon

Prism coupler Model 2010 along the three coordinates.

Measurements in the normal (ND), machine (MD) and

transverse direction (TD) were recorded. An average of 3–5 measurements was reported in each direction. Thermal

behavior was investigated on a Seiko SSC/5200 DSC. The

heating and cooling traces were recorded at 20 8C/min in a

nitrogen-purged atmosphere to study the melting and

crystallization of these samples. Small angle light scattering

(SALS) patterns in the Hn configuration were recorded at

ambient conditions by utilizing a He–Ne laser at 633 nm.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 11 cm.

Crystalline, amorphous and interfacial contents in

compression molded films were estimated by analyzing

the free induction decay (FID) data obtained from NMR

(method described below), although Alamo et al. [26] and

Mandelkern et al. [46,47] have utilized a different method

involving analysis of Raman spectra on LLDPEs based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In the present study, all

NMR measurements on compression molded films were

made using an Auburn IMR analyzer operating at 20 MHz.

Morphological analysis was accomplished by fitting the free

induction decay (FID) to a three-component model, viz.

crystalline, amorphous and interfacial. The data was

obtained using a 908 pulse (2 ms), 1 s pulse delay (which

was much greater than five times T1) and a 17 ms dead time

to eliminate signal contamination from the probe ring down.

Each FID consisted of 300 points, where each data point

was sampled every 1 ms, with 160 transients acquired to

improve signal-to-noise. The model utilized to fit the data

was based on the procedure suggested by Kristiansen [48].

where a is related to the hydrogen–hydrogen distance and b

is related to the width of Gaussian broadening. Since, a and

b are associated with the crystalline domain, and more

specifically a function of the hydrogen–hydrogen distance,

these two parameters are expected to be constant. Therefore,

a series of ten resins with densities from 0.918 to 0.960 were

analyzed. The values found for a and b did not vary much

and average values obtained were: aZ1.070eC05, bZ
72,940. These were used in all the fits reported in this study.

The two functions C[x] and S[x] are also referred as Fresnell

functions.

viz. interfacial and amorphous, can be expressed as the

where two separate sets of values of the pre-exponential

factor, A, spin–spin relaxation time, T2, and the Weilbullian

factor, d, were utilized for amorphous and interfacial

domains, respectively. The three equations were then solved

simultaneously by putting the FID data into an Excel

spreadsheet and using Microsoft Solver to find the best least

squared fit between the experimental data and the model.

Tensile stress–strain curves were recorded at 1 m/s on a

specialized MTS system 810. The servohydraulic actuator

was operated in displacement control. The force transducer

(Kistler 9712B50) was mounted directly to the crosshead.

The force signal was amplified with a Kistler 5010B and

acquired with a Nicolet Integra oscilloscope at data

acquisition rates of 10–40 kHz, depending on specimen

type. The specimen geometry utilized for tensile tests was

rectangular, 75!17 mm2. The distance between the jaws of

the tensile tester was 10 mm. For the DENT mode,

specimens of 25.4!25.4 mm2 (1!1 in.2) with ligament

lengths of 1, 2 and 3 mmwere tested at 1 m/s. It is noted that

for blown films, the specimens deformed in the MD

direction are representative of the measurement in the TD

as the crack propagates in the TD. Likewise, the samples

deformed in the TD are representative of the measurements

in the MD. Thus, the EWF results for blown films are

reported corresponding to the direction of the propagation of

the crack. For a thorough regressional analysis, at least five

specimens were tested at each ligament length. Prior to












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8825testing, the specimens were weighed to compute the average

thickness of the film in the ligament region. Individual

force–displacement curves were integrated by a computer

program to calculate the total fracture energy. This was then

normalized by the area of the ligament to provide the

specific fracture energy (wf) and then plotted against the

ligament length (l). Regression analysis of this data was

performed to obtain the values of the intercept which equals

the essential work of fracture, we.

4. Results and discussion

As can be seen in Table 1, the three copolymers (‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’) are essentially identical in their basic molecular

and rheological characteristics. These three resins have a

very similar melt flow index (1.01–1.09 g/10 min) and

density (0.917–0.918 g/cm3). The number average (Mn) and

weight average molecular weight (Mw) obtained from the

GPC are nearly identical (43.2–44.2 and 97.9–99 kg/mol,

respectively). The GPC curves for each of the three resins,

as shown in Fig. 2 are also comparable. This behavior is

further supported by very similar zero shear rate viscosity

values (7.13–7.26 kPa s). The polydispersity (2.22–2.27),

that reflects the breadth of the molecular weight distribution,

and the total comonomer content (2.47–2.95 mol%), as

obtained by NMR, is also very similar for each of these three

resins. The NMR data also indicate the presence of small

levels of ethyl branches in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resin (0.12 and

0.15 mol%, respectively). This is due to the generation of a

small level of ‘in situ’ ethyl branches that are indistinguish-

able from the ethyl branches introduced by 1-butene in the

copolymerization of ‘B’ copolymer. For the ‘H’ and ‘O’

resins, these ethyl branches were detected by NMR in

addition to the butyl and hexyl branches, respectively. Thus,
Fig. 2. Molecular weight distribution and the number of short chain

branches (corresponding to each resin) per 1000 carbon atoms of the

backbone of the three LLDPE resins (indicated on the secondary ordinate

axis).
the total mol% reported in Table 1 reflects the total amount

of short chain branches (including the very small amount of

ethyl branches in addition to the butyl or hexyl branches,

respectively, for the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resins). Nevertheless, the

total comononer content ([X] mol%) required to make a

0.918 g/cm3 density is somewhat higher for the 1-butene

copolymer than those based on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The

short chain branching distribution data is plotted in Fig. 2 (secondary ordinate axis). The number of short chain

branches/1000 C atoms in each of three resins is essentially

uniform (9–11/1000 C) across the width of the molecular

weight distribution. Despite some scatter at the low and

high-end of the molecular weight distribution that is

attributed to higher error in the measurements [44], the

three copolymer resins indicate a similar SCBD. Another

parameter that indicates the uniformity of the distribution of

short chain branches across the MWD is the % relative

monomer dispersity (%RMD) index, as determined by

solution NMR [51,52]. RMD is the tendency of the

comonomer units to be either ‘isolated’ (%RMDZ100) or

‘clustered’ (%RMD!100). The values of the three resins

utilized in this study are essentially the same, viz. 99.1, 99.7 and 99.3% for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively.

The information from the chemometric technique to

determine the SCBD (as reported in Fig. 2) does not indicate

the distribution of the short chain branches along a given

polymer chain. To ascertain any difference in this

distribution for the three copolymers, TREF was performed

on each of the LLDPE resins. These results are provided in

Fig. 3. All three resins (‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) possess the general

comonomer distribution profile characteristic of the resins

produced by single site metallocene catalysts [53,54]. In the

Ziegler–Natta catalyzed LLDPE resins, a low temperature

peak (between 45 and 55 8C) that is due to the elution of a

soluble fraction heavily concentrated with comonomers and

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378826a broad peak in the 55–80 8C range that is due to the elution

of ‘branched’ fraction made up of polymer molecules of

various comonomer contents are also observed [55].

However, the absence of the low temperature peaks (in

the range of 45–80 8C) in the TREF profiles of metallocene

catalyzed LLDPE resins utilized in this study indicate a

homogenous incorporation of the short chain comonomer in

the linear ethylene backbone as compared to resins

synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysts. A closer inspection

of the three profiles in Fig. 3 indicates some differences that

are most likely attributable to some level of difference in the

SCB distribution (along a given polymer chain) among the

three copolymers utilized in this study. These differences

show that resin ‘B’ has the most homogeneous crystal-

lizability/solubility behavior in comparison to ‘H’ and ‘O’.

These differences were primarily manifested in the ‘second

heating’ DSC results on blown and compression molded

films (results discussed in detail later, Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)),

where the presence of a low temperature shoulder on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ was

observed. This difference in the second melting DSC

behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise

from the slightly more homogenous distribution of SCB

(along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles. However, the SCBD data in

Fig. 2 and the near 100% RMD values of the three resins

indicate that the overall or average SCB distribution across

the MWD is in fact very similar for all three copolymers.

Hence, we believe that the magnitude of any differences that

may be observed in physical properties (discussed later)

cannot simply be attributed to this difference in the TREF

profiles.

The refractive index data on compression molded and

25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films is listed in Table 2. As can

be observed, within a given series (be it quenched, slow

cooled or blown) the average refractive index for the three

resins is essentially the same. As expected, the average

refractive indices of the slow cooled films are somewhat

higher than the corresponding quenched and blown films.

For the blown films, the refractive index was observed to be

slightly higher in the MD than that in TD, as might also be

expected. The difference in the refractive indices in the MD

and TD directions, respectively, nMDKnTD, gives the in-

plane birefringence, Dn. These are listed as well in the

extreme right in Table 2. The small values of Dn do not

indicate a high level of orientation along the MD (in

comparison to that in TD) in these films. The out-of-plane

birefringence, nMDKnND, is 0.0013, 0.0011 and 0.0015 for

‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, respectively. These values are

comparable to the in-plane birefringence, thereby indicating

a slight uniaxial orientation for these blown films. The

WAXS patterns taken with the beam parallel to the sample

film normal are shown in Fig. 4. The intensities of the

(1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections show some azimuthal

dependence, as expected. In particular, the (200) reflections

are slightly lower in intensity at the equator than that at the

meridian, thereby indicating a low a-axis orientation along

the MD. This is a common observation for polyethylene

blown films produced at low stress levels. As expected, the

(110) plane reflections, on the other hand, have a relatively

lower meridianal intensity than that observed equatorially.

Returning to the refractive index data in Table 2, the

density of the films from the average refractive index was

calculated by the following relationship [56]:

the LLDPE films are listed in Table 2. For the samples in a

given series (be it quenched, slow cooled or blown), the

films (based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) had essentially the same

density and consequently %Xc within limits of experimental

error. This is in agreement with the results reported by

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene at a given mol% of the

short chain branch comonomer. Their work did not support

the notion that any of the short chain branches are included

in the crystalline lattice. In the present study, the density and

consequently the %Xc of the blown and quenched films are

lower than the slow cooled samples, as expected.

The lamellar scale lengths in the quenched and slow

cooled compression molded films are indicated by SAXS

results in Fig. 5. As can be seen, within a given series, the

scattering patterns are essentially identical for ‘B’, ‘H’ and

‘O’. It is clear that the differences in TREF profiles in Fig. 3 do not affect the SAXS behavior on the lamellar scale for

both the series investigated (compression molded quenched

and slow cooled). As expected, the long period is larger in

slow cooled films (223 Å) than that in quenched films

(205 Å). In addition, the results from the free induction

decay NMR experiments, that gives information on the














P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378828relative contents of ‘rigid’ (crystalline), ‘intermediate’

(interfacial) and ‘mobile or liquid-like’ (amorphous) phases

indicated that the content of these phases was very similar

for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ within a given series in the compression

molded samples (Fig. 6). For the compression molded

quenched samples, the weight fractions of crystalline,

interfacial and amorphous domains are ca. 59.5, 29.8 and

11.3%, respectively, in ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ films, while the

respective values for the compression molded slow cooled

are 63.1, 24.5 and 12.7%. The calculated crystalline content

in the slow cooled films is larger than for the quenched

films, as expected. However, the interfacial content in the

slow cooled films is slightly less than that in the quenched

films, although the amorphous content is very similar in

both the compression molded series. In general, the values

of crystallinity obtained from free induction decay NMR

tends to be higher than those obtained from DSC. This is due

to the fact that taut tie molecules can also contribute to the

‘rigid’ phase. Very recently, Yoon et al. [58] utilized SAXS

and solid-state NMR method (rotor-encoded rotational echo

double resonance technique) to investigate the structure of

metallocene catalyzed LLDPEs as a function of comonomer

type (1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) and content. They

also did not observe any structural differences in their series

of ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials investigated that had a ca.

3 mol% comonomer content.

Returning to the present study, larger scale lengths at the

micro level for our materials were characterized by SALS.

The spherulitic scale lengths in the compression molded

quenched and slow cooled films are indicated by the Hn

SALS in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the SALS patterns (within a

given series, be it quenched or slow cooled), are similar for

the ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. These ‘four-lobed’ patterns are

characteristic of a spherulitic morphology. However, when

comparing the patterns of the slow cooled with that of the

quenched films, it appears that the slow cooled films have

larger but less well-defined spherulitic structures than the

quenched films. This was also supported by the surface

analysis of these films by scanning electron microscopy

(SEM) (results not shown here). The SALS patterns in the

Hn configuration can be utilized to calculate the average size

of the spherulites by use of the following relationship

[59–61]:

4pR

2

 
Z 4:13 (10) where R, is the radius of the spherulites, lm is the

wavelength in the scattering medium and qmax is the angle

of intensity maxima in one of the lobes of the Hn pattern.

The calculated diameter for the quenched films was in the

range of 2.9–3.6 mm (B–Q: 3.3 mm, H–Q: 2.9 mm and O–Q:

3.6 mm) whereas the slow cooled films were in the range of

3.8–4.2 mm (B–SC: 3.8 mm, H–SC: 4.2 mm and O–SC:

4.2 mm). As expected, the size of the spherulites in the slow

cooled films is larger than that in quenched films.

Furthermore, the SEM analysis on these films indicated a

broad distribution of sizes (data not shown).

The first and second DSC heating–cooling profiles of the

blown films are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The

first heating (Fig. 8(a)) is extremely comparable for each of

the three, ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, with melting

transition peaks in the range of 117–119 8C. The first

cooling curves indicate a lower temperature primary

crystallization exotherm peak for ‘B’ (93 8C) than the ‘H’

(95.5 8C), which in turn is slightly lower than ‘O’ (96.5 8C).

It might be postulated that a lower primary crystallization

temperature peak (higher effective degree of undercooling)

indicates crystallization of relatively smaller-sized crystals

as compared to the sample that crystallized at a higher

temperature. The slightly smaller-sized lamellar crystals

should therefore begin to melt at a lower temperature. This

is confirmed by the endotherm peak positions in the second

heating cycles, where ‘B’ shows the peak endotherm at

116.5 8C whereas ‘H’ and ‘O’ show the second melting

endotherm peaks at 117.5 8C. The second heating profiles

are shown in Fig. 8(b). A distinct ‘shoulder’ in the second

cycle melting endotherm at 109–113 8C for the ‘H’ and ‘O’

films (Fig. 8(b)) can be clearly seen in comparison to the ‘B’

film, which does not show a distinct shoulder. This

difference in the second melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise from the more

interchain homogeneity of SCB in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Another noticeable and

identical feature in the first and second cooling curves is the

presence of a small exotherm transition at 63 8C for each of

the three films within a given series, be it blown, quenched

or slow cooled. This secondary crystallization is postulated

to lead to the formation of a second population of lamellar

crystals that are thinner than those formed during the

primary crystallization process at higher temperatures.

The DSC results of the compression molded films are












Fig. 7. Small angle light scattering results in the Hn configuration on compression molded films.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8829shown in Fig. 9, where only the heating curves are shown.

Based on the first heating curves (Fig. 9(a)), the melting

peaks of the quenched and slow cooled films are in the range

of 115–117 8C. Only the slow cooled films of ‘H’ and ‘O’

show a slightly broader melting endotherm than that of ‘B’.

These samples were left in the insulated DSC chamber and

allowed to cool down to room temperature in about 2 h after

which they were heated again and the corresponding second

heating curves were recorded (Fig. 9(b)). As can be seen, a

behavior similar to what was observed for the blown films is

noted. Specifically, the presence of a ‘shoulder’ on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ (for both quenched and

slow cooled) is much more distinct and marked as these

samples were cooled very slowly after the first melting (as

against a cooling rate of 20 8C/min for the blown films). As

stated earlier, the slightly broader first melting endotherms

of ‘H’ and ‘O’ than ‘B’ and the difference in the second

melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’

could arise from the slightly more homogenous distribution

of SCB (along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and

‘O’, as indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, it

can be said that the thermal behavior based on the first

heating responses of these films ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ (be it

quenched or blown) are very similar. In the compression

molded slow cooled films, whether the slightly broader first

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ play a role in governing

the mechanical properties at slow deformation rates of these

films will become clear in the following discussion.

The tensile properties of the 25 mm thick blown films and

compression molded films that were measured at slow draw

rates, ca. 0.0004–0.008 m/s, (25–510 mm/min) are shown in

Fig. 10. The yield and breaking strength are essentially the

same for the films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ in each

direction (MD or TD). For the LLDPE blown films, due to

preferential orientation of the lamellar crystals, the TD

modulus tends to be higher than the MD modulus [13].

However, for the films investigated here, the low levels of

orientation translates to the modulus being only marginally

higher along the TD. Likewise, the tensile properties of the

compression molded films (Fig. 10(b)) at conventional draw

rates indicate very comparable yield and breaking strengths

for films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, within a given series.

Within the limits of error, the tensile modulus is also very

similar for films based on three resins in each series. These

results clearly indicate that the slight differences in the

TREF profiles in Fig. 3 and differences in first melting DSC

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films really do

not play any role in governing the mechanical properties

when obtained at slow deformation rates (up to 0.008 m/s).

To ascertain any differences in the tensile properties at

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378830higher deformation rates, the stress strain behavior was

measured at a higher deformation rate of 1 m/s (about two

orders of magnitude higher than before). These results are

shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b) for 25 mm thick blown and

compression molded films. Due to the extremely high rate of

data acquisition, the ‘ringing’ characteristics of the load

path’s mechanical elements (primarily the load cell/grip

assembly) appear as oscillations in the ‘yield’ region of the

curves. However, the yield strength values of both the blown

and compression molded films are readily distinguished,

and all fall in the range of 17–20 MPa. The ‘H’ and ‘O’

blown films also show a higher breaking strain than that for

corresponding ‘B’ films (Fig. 11(a)). Likewise, B–Q and

B–SC underwent failure before yielding or plastic drawing

could take place whereas, with the exception of the ‘O–SC’,

the compression molded ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials yield, draw

and undergo significant post ‘natural draw ratio’ defor-

mation before failure (Fig. 11(b)). A noticeable trend was

observed in the breaking strengths. The breaking strength of

the 1-butene based films (‘B’) is distinctly lower than that

for the 1-hexene (‘H’) and 1-octene (‘O’) based films,

regardless of film type (quenched, slow cooled or blown).

For the blown films, the ‘B’ films have a breaking strength

of ca. 21–24 MPa as compared to that of 31–36 MPa for ‘H’

and ‘O’ films. In either direction (MD or TD) the ‘H’ and

‘O’ films also show distinctly greater strain hardening when

compared to the ‘B’ films, and this accounts for the higher

values of the breaking strengths. Similarly, strain hardening

can be observed in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ compression molded

films. The quenched and slow cooled films of ‘B’ do not

undergo any strain hardening and display much lower

breaking strengths (6–10 MPa) as compared to the high

values of the ‘H’ and ‘O’ films (16–26 MPa). Note that

when the breaking strengths of the compression molded and

blown films corresponding to the same resin are compared,

the blown films have superior properties. Comparing the

results in Figs. 9 and 10, it can be inferred that the breaking

strength of blown films of ‘B’ is lower than that of ‘H’ and

‘O’, an effect that is evident only at high deformation rates.

Further tests conducted on the blown films to measure

Elmendorf tear properties, where high deformation rates of

0.1–1, 0.1–7 and 0.2–4 m/s, respectively, were utilized, also

confirm this behavior. As shown in Fig. 12, the dart impact

strength, at any given film gage, of ‘B’ is significantly lower

than that of ‘H’ and ‘O’. During the dart impact testing,

some of the films, especially at higher gage, did not rupture

at the maximum allowable force corresponding to the

falling dart of 1400 g. Hence, those values are reported as

‘O1400 g’ in Fig. 12. Turning to the results in Fig. 13(a)

and (b), it is clearly noted that Elmendorf tear and Spencer

impact strength increase with increasing short chain branch

length at any given blown film thickness. Furthermore,

within samples of the same copolymer type (‘B’, ‘H’ or ‘O’)

these properties increase with increasing blown film

thickness, as would be expected. Of particular importance

is that for any given direction (MD or TD), the Elmendorf

tear strength and Spencer impact strength increase in the

order: ‘O’O‘H’O‘B’. The results of the puncture resistance

measurements on compression molded quenched and slow

cooled plaques are given in Fig. 14, which again support that

the materials based on 1-butene are inferior to those based

on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The load-deformation curves are

plotted in Fig. 14(a) for the representative samples

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively, in each

series (quenched and slow cooled). Five specimens

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378832corresponding each to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ in each series

(quenched and slow cooled) were tested (load-deformation

curves of representative specimens shown Fig. 14(a)). The

results indicated a good reproducibility for each material

type. The average integrated energy to rupture and the

deformation to failure are plotted in Fig. 14(b). As can be

seen, within a given series, be it quenched and slow cooled,

the total deformation to failure (plotted on the secondary

axis of Fig. 14(b)), of ‘H’ and ‘O’ is higher than that of ‘B’,

indicating an increased ductile failure in ‘H’ and ‘O’. This

was also confirmed visually by the fact that the deformed

‘H’ and ‘O’ samples had a longer and ductile sleeve

(relative to that in ‘B’) that emanated from the region where

the mechanically driven tup exited the sample. This is also

reflected as higher total rupture energies for ‘H’ and ‘O’

(55–61 J) than ‘B’ (30–37 J). However, in all these tests,

viz. dart impact, Spencer impact and Elmendorf Tear the

rate of deformation of the films is not well-defined. In a dart

impact measurement, a falling dart ruptures the film held in

tension and the equivalent force to rupture is recorded in

terms of the mass of the falling dart. In the case of the

Spencer impact strength measurements, a piece of film is

held in tension and punctured with a hemispherical head

attached to a swinging pendulum whereas in Elmendorf tear

resistance, the precut film sample is ruptured by a swinging

pendulum. In the puncture resistance measurements the

sample is held in tension and punctured by a pneumatically

driven tup/dart. In either configuration, the deformation rate

of the film can be visualized to be a maximum at the

initiation (when the pendulum or the ball/dart hits the film)

and then decreases thereafter as the crack progresses (as

most of the energy carried by the pendulum or the ball/dart

has already been spent in overcoming the initial resistance).

Thus, the rates of deformation (reported above) are at best

estimates and never an exact value, as the deformation

process of the samples is not well-controlled.

To characterize the deformation of the films in a more

well-defined extensional regime, tear resistance properties

were measured by utilizing the essential work of fracture

(recall earlier discussion of this methodology). Here, precut

films that have a specified ligament length were deformed

in a tensile manner at 1 m/s to investigate their tear

resistance properties. A typical stress–displacement behav-

ior for the blown film based on resin ‘H’ is shown for two

ligament lengths, viz. 1 and 3 mm in Fig. 15(a) and (b).

notched tensile test (DENT) mode of ethylene/1-hexene blown film in the

(corresponding to each ligament length and marked as i, ii, iii and iv) are

shown to indicate reproducibility.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8833Three stress–displacement curves (marked as i, ii and iii)

corresponding to three specimens (with the same ligament

length) are shown to indicate the reproducibility in the data.

The tear specimens satisfy the plane stress conditions [Eqs.

(3) and (4) in Section 2] and fail right after the yield and do

not undergo any plastic stretching that is characteristic of

the samples in a conventional tensile deformation test.

Further, the larger ligament length specimens had a larger

strain at break. This is due to the fact that at larger ligament

lengths, there is more material in the ligament that

undergoes deformation in comparison to that in the smaller

ligament lengths. However, the yield stress is practically the

same at both the ligament lengths, as expected. Stress–

displacement curves were obtained in a similar fashion for

the 25 mm thick blown films of ‘B’ and ‘O’ and all the

compression molded films. Based on the procedure outlined

in Section 2, the specific fracture energy, obtained by

integrating the stress–strain curve, was fitted by a linear

relationship when plotted against the ligament length. The

intercepts of these plots, then gave the essential work of

fracture. These results are shown in Fig. 16. For the blown

films (Fig. 16(a)) in each of the direction (MD or TD), the

essential work of fracture is observed to increase with

increasing short chain branch length, a result consistent with

the impact strength and Elmendorf tear resistance measure-

ments. As stated before, when a blown film specimen is

stretched along the MD, the crack propagates along the TD.

Therefore, when the specimen is being stretched along the

MD, the measured EWF is representative of the TD

direction. Consequently, the EWF along the TD is greater

than that along the MD. This is consistent with the tear

resistance being greater along the TD than along the MD

(Fig. 13(a)), which in turn is a manifestation of the preferred

lamellar orientation [13,14] (although only slight in this

study). For the compression molded quenched films

(Fig. 16(b)), the essential work of fracture of films based

on 1-butene was also observed to be less than that of the

1-hexene and 1-octene films. However, within the limits of

experimental error, the EWF results of the slow cooled films

do not indicate a strong dependence on the short chain












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378834branch length. Thus, based on the results discussed so far, it

can be inferred that the mechanical properties of the films of

the three essentially identical linear low density polyethy-

lene copolymers based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene

show a dependence on the length of short chain branch only

at high rates of deformation. This is summarized in Table 3, where at slower rates of deformation, the mechanical

properties were observed to be similar but quite different at

higher deformation rates. This is due to the fact that these

films are very similar in their molecular, rheological and

structural aspects that any effects due to the different short

chain lengths (present in small amounts of ca. 2.5–3 mol%)

do not get reflected at slower deformation rates. However, at

high deformation rates, these effects become prominent

such that the mechanical properties of films based on

1-butene were observed to be lower than those based on

1-hexene and 1-octene. Recalling that the primary objective

of this study was to further investigate the effect of the

length of short chain branch on the physical properties of

LLDPEs, the results presented here have shown that the

length of the short chain branch does play an important role

in influencing the mechanical properties of the LLDPEs in

agreement with earlier results [28] and furthermore

established that this effect is pronounced only at high rates

of deformation.

With regards to the origin of the effect of the difference in

short chain branch length on the mechanical properties

when measured at high rates of deformation, it seems

difficult to attribute this to the amorphous phase in view of

the low mole percentage of the branches and the fact that the

rheological behavior of at least the melt state shows no

significant differences. We did investigate the DMA

(dynamic mechanical analysis) behavior of the film

materials (data not shown) but did not find any distinct

variations between the materials although we admit that the

DMA tests were determined in the lower frequency range

(0.001–10 Hz). We conjecture that the origin of the effect of

the difference in short chain branch length on the

mechanical properties is coupled to its influence on the

deformation behavior of the crystalline phase. It has been

speculated [21,24,62,63] that a short chain branch prevents

the formation of crystalline regions in its immediate vicinity

leading to an increased probability of the main chain to

which it is attached to be incorporated into two different

lamellae, thereby establishing that portion of the chain as a

bridge or a tie molecule. If this supposition is true, then the

enhanced properties, associated with plastic deformation

(ductility, toughness, tear resistance, etc.), could be due to

an increasing number of tie molecules with increasing molar

content of short chain branches. However, this postulate

does not explain the EWF results on slow cooled films

where the essential work of fracture was not observed to be

strongly dependent on the branch length. For the three series

of films investigated in this study, viz. the blown, quenched

and slow cooled, the latter had the slowest rate of

crystallization and hence the highest opportunity to form a

more thermodynamically desirable equilibrium structure.

Thus, if tie molecule formation is favored at longer branch

lengths that consequently result in larger values of strength,

then this effect (‘O’w‘H’O‘B’) should be more pro-

nounced in the EWF results on slow cooled in comparison to

blown and quenched films. However, this is not the case.

Therefore, it is difficult to envision the increased formation

of tie molecules with increasing short chain branch length.

We, however, postulate that during the process of

deformation at high rates (1 m/s), the length of the short

chain branch may play an important role when it is pulled

into and potentially through the chain folded lamellar

regions as they deform. A very simplified schematic of this

concept is shown in Fig. 17. The magnitude of the resistance

offered by a shorter branch length undergoing deformation

through the crystalline regions could be lower than that

experienced by a longer branch length. Furthermore, for

LLDPEs that have only a few mol% (!5 mol%) of the short

chain branch comonomer, it is possible that this effect would

be pronounced at higher rates of deformation. This is

because at lower rates (0.0004 m/s) of deformation the

polymer chains have a longer time scale to respond to the

deformation, and consequently the resistance offered by

the branch during deformation may be independent of its

length. However, while this explanation is a hypothesis that

might explain the observed phenomena, it is yet to be

confirmed. Future investigations need to be conducted to

gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of

deformation and their rate dependence at the molecular

level.

In the past, some attempts to investigate the slow crack

growth in polyethylenes have been conducted, [64–66]

on the right.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8835however, investigating the specific behavior of the SCB

during deformation especially at a higher rate is not trivial

as the choice of a suitable experiment that will allow such a

characterization is difficult. Another potential way to

investigate such behavior at high deformation rates might

be by the dynamic modeling of the deformation phenomena

that could trace a given SCB as it is pulled through the

crystalline regions during the deformation at higher rate.

Certainly, as such modeling codes become more predictive,

the approach may help to address the distinct differences

observed in our study.

5. Summary

Three LLDPE resins synthesized by a single site

metallocene catalyst using 1-butene, 1-hexene, and

1-octene as co-monomers were characterized to be

essentially identical in terms of their molecular weight

and distribution melt rheology, density, crystallinity, and

short chain branching content. The resins were also very

homogenous with respect to the short chain branch

distribution across their MWD, although very slight

differences were observed in the TREF profiles of the

three resins. Therefore, this sample set allows us to evaluate

the exclusive influence exerted by the short chain branch

length on the physical properties of the resulting films;

many previous attempts by other workers to accomplish

the same objective have been confounded by samples

that differed substantially in their chemical composition.

The physical properties of isotropic compression molded

(slow-cooled and quenched) films as well as blown films of

the subject LLDPEs were investigated using a variety of

tests carried out at widely differing deformation rates. The

blown films made from these resins had low levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and the flat plate WAXS

measurements indicated low a-axis orientation along the

MD (Keller–Machin low stress row structure). Within the

compression molded quenched and slow cooled series,

the lamellar and spherulitic scale lengths as determined by

SAXS and SALS indicated very similar dimensions

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. The blown and

compression molded films formed from these resins were

also found to be similar to each other (within a given series,

be it blown, quenched or slow cooled) in terms of

crystallinity, and overall crystallization characteristics,

although, slightly broader melting endotherms of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ were observed in the first melting

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films.

However, the tensile properties of slow cooled ‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min) were

very similar, thereby clearly indicating that these slight

differences in the TREF behavior and differences in first

melting DSC profiles of compression molded slow cooled

films really do not play any role in governing the final

mechanical properties of the LLDPE films obtained at

slower deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min).

At higher deformation rates (1 m/s), however, the

breaking strength was observed to increase with increasing

short chain branch length for all the samples investigated

(blown, quenched and slow cooled). This is consistent with

an earlier study [28] utilizing the same polymers and films










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378836investigated here, where the impact and tear strength of

blown films based on 1-octene and 1-hexene were found to

be considerably better than those of films based on 1-butene.

While the deformation rates in the above mentioned tests are

quite high, the rates change considerably during the

measurement. Therefore, the deformation characteristics

of the subject films were also studied in a well-defined and

controlled regime by analyzing the essential work of

fracture for the blown and compressed films. For the

blown films, the essential work of fracture was found to

increase systematically with increasing short chain branch

length. For the compression molded films, the 1-hexene and

1-octene based films performed better than the 1-butene

films. In general, the mechanical properties of 1-octene

based systems were somewhat enhanced relative to those

based on 1-hexene. However, this is not an all inclusive

statement, as the compression molded films of ‘O’

performed equally to ‘H’ in high speed tensile (breaking

strength at 1 m/s), puncture resistance and EWF tear tests.

From these results, it can be concluded that the length of the

short chain branch length plays a crucial role in determining

the mechanical properties of LLDPE, especially at high

deformation rates. It is hypothesized that the magnitude of

the resistance offered by a shorter branch length undergoing

deformation through the crystalline regions could be lower

than that offered by a longer branch length. However,

further studies to gain a better understanding of the

underlying physical process of deformation need to be

conducted.

ABSTRACT: Top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene (PE)
films exposed to corona discharge display large and opposite
electrostatic potentials, forming an electric bilayer in agree-
ment with recent and unexpected findings from Zhiqiang et al.
Water wetting, chemical composition and roughness of the
two surfaces are different. Surprisingly, the bottom surface,
opposite to the corona electrode is charged but it is not
oxidized, neither is it wetted with water. Moreover, its
morphology is unaltered by charging, while the hydrophilic
top surface is much rougher with protruding islands that are
the result of oxidation followed by phase separation and
polymer−polymer dewetting. Common liquids extract the oxidized, hydrophilic material formed at the upper surface, a result
that explains the well-known sensitivity of adhesive joints made using corona-treated thermoplastics to liquids, especially water.
These results show that poling the surface closer to the corona electrode triggers another but different charge build-up process at
the opposite surface. The outcome is another poled PE surface showing high potential but with unchanged chemical
composition, morphology and wetting behavior as the pristine surface, thus opening new possibilities for surface engineering.

1. INTRODUCTION
Corona discharge is widely used in industry to improve wetting
and adhesion characteristics of polymers for applications in
adhesive bonding and printing.1−3 The surface modification is
triggered by ions formed in the air when a sufficiently large
potential difference is applied between two asymmetric
electrodes (generally, a curved and a plate electrode), creating
a large electric field that accelerates ions toward the polymer
surface. The increased adhesion and wettability of polymers
subjected to this treatment is mainly related to the introduction
of polar groups due to oxidation and other concurrent chemical
and physical changes in the surface.4−9 In a conventional corona discharge device, the curved
electrode is biased and the plate electrode is grounded.10,11 However, other geometric arrangements have been used for
specific applications. For instance, the decomposition of phenol
in water was enhanced when a stainless steel cylinder, covered
with multiwalled carbon nanotubes, was used as the grounded
electrode in a wetted-wall corona-discharge reactor.12 An
inverted configuration, where the needle is the grounded
electrode and the plate electrode is biased, was used to increase
the removal efficiency of aerosol particles from the gas using a
grounded atomizing water discharge electrode.13 The use of inverted corona setup during polymer treatment
is interesting, since the needle can be safely filled with
grounded liquids, thus being a source of ions derived from the
liquid vapor. This type of experiment is difficult to control
when using a biased needle as in the conventional geometry,
because the reduction of surface tension of the biased liquid

exiting the needle forms elongated jets that break into
droplets.14,15 It is well-known that polymer surfaces subjected to corona
treatment acquire high electrostatic potential due to the
deposition of positive or negative ions16−18 that migrate
through the atmosphere driven by the electric field until they
bind to a surface. Positive discharge provides solvated protons
[(H2O)nH

+]19 as the most abundant species, while CO3−,
NO3−, NO2−, O3−, and O2− were identified by mass
spectrometry as the main reactants formed by negative
discharge.20 Upon hitting the polymer surface, ions can trigger
the formation of unstable free radicals and ionic species.
Recent papers from Chen’s group21−23 show, using the

pulsed electroacoustic technique (PEA), that the polyethylene
surface facing the plate electrode (bottom surface) also acquires
a significant amount of charge during corona treatment.
However, the sign of charge in the bottom surface is opposite
to the sign of charge deposited on the surface facing the curved
electrode (top surface), showing that a bipolar charge injection
takes place during the corona treatment. These recent results
show that the effect of corona discharge on PE is much more
complex than previously acknowledged.
Charge carriers responsible for the top surface charging in a

corona treatment are well established in the literature,19,20 but
the mechanism of recently disclosed bottom charging has not

yet been elucidated. This is due to the well-known difficulty of
identification of charge-bearing species in electrified insula-
tors.24−32 Chen23 proposed that the charge carriers responsible for the
polyethylene bottom surface charging subjected to corona
treatment are injected from the plate electrode, being electrons
from the cathode and holes from the anode, according to the
Schottky mechanism. This can now be reinterpreted consider-
ing recent results that identify ions derived from the sample
polymers as the charge carriers in contact and tribocharg-
ing.24−26,28,32 The aim of the present work is to gather information at the
macroscopic and microscopic levels to better understand
charging processes involved in corona treatment as well as
their effect on polyethylene surfaces. The present results show,
for the first time, that the macroscopic charge bilayers, formed
during the discharge, have surfaces with different roughness,
water wetting ability, and chemical composition. Besides,
extraction with solvents reveals that common liquids dissolve
some components of the oxidized surfaces, according to their
Hildebrand parameters, and the reason for the formation of the
rough upper surface is explained considering the immiscibility
between PE and the oxidized PE formed during the corona
treatment.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Chemicals. Samples were prepared by cutting 140-μm-thick

blown LDPE films into small pieces (10 mm × 10 mm). LDPE film
identity was verified by ATR infrared, as shown in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information. Prior to use, the polyethylene samples were
immersed for 10 min in ethanol within an ultrasonic bath and then
dried at room temperature.
Reagent-grade ethanol, acetone, butanol, chloroform, toluene, and

hexane were acquired from Synth (Saõ Paulo) and used as received.
Millipore water was used throughout.
In some experiments, the bottom side of PE films pieces was coated

with ca. 10 nm Au/Pd film using a MED 020 (Bal-Tec) instrument.
2.2. Inverted Corona Discharge Treatment. The inverted

corona treatment setup used for charging the samples is schematically
represented in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. In this
configuration, the needle is grounded and the plate electrode is biased.
Preliminary observations, using the applied voltage from 4 to 7 kV,

revealed that below ±5 kV no major changes in water wettability took
place, while beyond ±6 kV, a spark discharge was observed during the
experiment. Thus, positive (+5 kV and +6 kV) and negative (−5 kV
and −6 kV) tension was applied during 3 min to the plate electrode
using a Spellman CZE 1000R power supply, while the grounded
needle was kept filled with water. The distance between the electrodes
was fixed at 6 mm, providing an electric field greater than the
breakdown strength of the air.33 The temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and the
relative humidity (50 ± 2 %RH) were controlled during the
experiments.
2.3. Electrostatic Potential Measurement. Electrostatic poten-

tial maps were obtained for corona-treated polyethylene films. The
scanning apparatus was built by Optron (Campinas). The sample
holder was an aluminum plate where the polymer film was laid. The
potential probe is a 5-mm-diameter Kelvin electrode connected to a
Trek model 347 noncontact voltmeter. This electrode is mounted on a
mechanical arm that allows it to scan the x−y plane, under
microcomputer control. The entire ensemble is mounted within a
closed metal box, which enables control of the atmospheric
composition, especially the relative humidity. The spatial resolution
of the potential measurement (5 × 5 mm2) was limited by the Kelvin
electrode dimensions and the time allowed for the electrometer to
equilibrate on each pixel was 1 s.
2.4. Allignment of Charged PE Film within an Electric Field.

Corona-treated polyethylene was exposed to the electric field

generated between two vertical parallel-plate electrodes 40 mm
apart. Voltage in one plate changed from 0 to 2 kV or from 0 to −2kV, while the other one was grounded. The film sample was placed
equidistant from both electrodes, suspended by a thin cotton thread,
and it was observed while voltage was changed. A movie was recorded
using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.5. Electric Suspension. Horizontal parallel-plate electrodes
were mounted to verify polyethylene levitation. The charged PE
sample was placed in between the two electrodes, and voltage was
gradually changed in one electrode while the other was grounded. A
movie was recorded using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.6. Charge Excess Measurement and Charge Excess
Simulation. Pieces of polyethylene treated by inverted corona
discharge were inserted within a Faraday cup connected to the input
of a Keithley 610C electrometer and the charge excess was
immediately read. Charge was also evaluated from electrostatic
potential measurements applying the superposition principle to a
virtual charge distribution, using a previously described proce-
dure.29−31 The total electrostatic potential (VT) generated by all
surface charges at the plane 2 mm away from a charge-carrying surface
(r = 5 mm) is thus calculated using a C2+ code for eq 1: ∑ ∑

and ε is the dielectric constant of the medium.

A squared area (5 × 5 mm2) of the electrostatic map is represented
by a 200 × 200 pixel matrix. The virtual charge distribution on the
matrix is adjusted by trial and error, until the calculated and the
experimental electric potentials in every pixel have similar values.
Then, the surface charge excess values obtained for top and bottom
polyethylene surfaces were subtracted and compared to the measured
value.

2.7. Contact Angle Measurement. Contact angle of 5 μL water
droplets deposited on corona-treated polyethylene films were
measured by the Young−Laplace (sessile drop fitting) method using
a Krüss Easydrop DSA20 instrument.

2.8. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The surface composi-
tion of corona-treated polyethylene was analyzed by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha
instrument equipped with aluminum Kα line and a VG-CLAMP-2electron hemispherical analyzer, providing an energy resolution of
∼0.85 eV. The atomic composition of the samples was determined by
integrating the core-level peaks, properly weighted by the photo-
emission cross section.

2.9. Atomic Force Microscopy. Topography and phase contrast
images of the corona-treated polyethylene films were obtained in
noncontact mode using a Shimadzu SPM-9600 microscope with a
Nanoworld silicon tip (resonance frequency = 320 kHz and force
constant = 42 N/m). The scanning system is enclosed within an
environmental chamber under controlled temperature and relative
humidity.

2.10. Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy. Solids
extracted from the film surfaces were imaged using a Libra 120 Zeiss
transmission microscope, equipped with an Omega energy filter, that
allows the acquisition of EELS (electron energy loss spectra). A
droplet of solvent used to rinse the PE surface was directly deposited
in the carbon film over a TEM sample holder grid, then dried for 30min under air, and the sample was introduced in the microscope.
Bright-field images and EELS spectra were acquired.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Macroscopic Characterization. When the needle

electrode is either positive or negative relative to the plate
electrode, PE upper surface acquires electric potential with the
same sign as the needle electrode, even when this is grounded.
Averages from triplicate surface potential measurements are

presented in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. After

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901893 either +6 kV or −6 kV under the standard and inverted corona
geometries is applied, the absolute values of electrostatic
potential measured on the top surface layer are all similar
(ranging from ±1500 to 1600 V), but with opposite signs.
The polymer surface in contact with the plate electrode

(bottom surface) also displays significant electrostatic potential,
with signal opposite to that measured on the top surface
(Figure 1). As an example, after the needle electrode is

grounded and −6 kV is applied to the plate electrode (positive
inverted corona), the electrostatic potential acquired on the
upper film side is (+1602 ± 105) V, while on the bottom, it is
(−1145 ± 49) V. Thus, the polymer layer that is in contact
with the lower plate but not directly exposed to the corona also
acquires charge, forming a positive/negative charge bilayer that
in turn creates a field measuring ca. 20 kV mm−1 across the
polymer bulk.
Observation of the charged film within an electric field

provides visible evidence of its dipolar nature. Movies 1 and 2(avi format) show a film treated by positive inverted corona
between two electrodes. After a gradual negative voltage is
applied to one electrode and the other is grounded, the film
rotates until the positive surface faces the negative electrode
and then attaches to it, as shown in movie 1. Vice versa, when
the applied voltage was set as positive (movie 2), the film
rotates so as to attach the negative surface to the positive
electrode.

To verify how the charging process works in a multilayer,
three superimposed 140 μm polyethylene films (arranged as a
sandwich) were stacked on top of the horizontal plate
electrode, and this was biased to +6 kV in the inverted corona
arrangement. Figure 2a shows the electrostatic potential

measured on each film surface. The piece that was laid in
contact with the plate electrode during the treatment (lower
film) presents positive electric potential on both surfaces, while
the upper film acquires negative potential on both surfaces.
Both sides of the middle film are charged, but one is negative
and the other is positive. Furthermore, the absolute values of
the electrostatic potential are lower than those measured for
only one film, suggesting that the charge carriers deposited on
PE during the poling process are diluted through the polymer
sandwich. This also shows that charge builds up in a film that is
isolated both from the lower electrode and from the ionized
atmosphere adjacent to the needle electrode.
Electrostatic charge excess of the polymer sandwich was also

measured, using the Faraday cup. The results shown in Figure
2b are in agreement with electric potential measurements. The
lower film has positive charge excess, while the upper film is
negative and the film that was placed in the middle of each
sandwich presents charge excess close to zero.
In other experiment, the bottom surface of polyethylene film

samples was metal-coated with Au/Pd prior to charging.
Potential on the top side of films treated by grounding the
needle and applying −6 kV to the plate electrode (inverted
positive corona) is (+1699 ± 99) V, the same as in the
uncoated samples. Nevertheless, the electrostatic potential
measured on the bottom surface is close to zero, revealing that
opposite charges are not retained on it (see Figure 3).

polyethylene films exposed to the needle electrode (top side) and to
the plate electrode (bottom side): (a) standard and (b) inverted
corona arrangements. Voltage applied to needle/plate electrodes is

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901894 Corona-charged samples with the conductive layer on one
side levitate within a vertical electric field of ca. −200 kV/m, as
shown in Movie 3 (availabe in avi format). Non-metal-coated
samples do not levitate, even when a much higher voltage is
applied to the top electrode, probably due to the lower net
charge in the bilayer charged film.
Surface potential decay as a function of time under constant

relative humidity (70% RH) was measured for polyethylene
films treated using positive (−5 kV) and negative (+5 kV)
inverted corona. Sample scanning started immediately after
each sample was charged. Figure 4a shows the potential decay
curves from top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene treated by
−5 kV inverted corona. Both curves level off at the negative
equilibrium potential (ca. −5 V) that was recently discovered in
this research group.34 From each plot, the time required to
halve the initial potential (see Figure 4b) is obtained and
defined as the potential half-life.
Polyethylene pieces treated by positive corona present

significant difference between the half-lives measured on top
and on bottom surfaces: the half-life of the negative potential
on the bottom layer is three times longer than for the positive
potential on top surface. On the other hand, when the
polyethylene films are treated by negative corona discharge, the
half-lives measured on top (negative) and bottom (positive)
surfaces are quite similar. Altogether, these results show that
different charge-bearing species contribute to surface charging.
To determine if the charging processes alter the polyethylene

surface free energy, contact angles for water with top and
bottom surface layers were acquired as soon as the samples
were charged, and the results are shown in Table 1. Top
surfaces exposed to inverted corona discharge show contact
angle 40° lower than the untreated samples, but the bottom
surfaces are unchanged. Contact angles were followed for 60days after film charging to evaluate surface aging under air.
After 50 days aging at 60% RH, the contact angle measured on
the top surface reverted to the original values of untreated film.
A remarkable feature observed in corona-treated poly-

ethylene is that immersion in ethanol, butanol, acetone,
toluene, and chloroform easily removes top and bottom surface
charges. Films treated by positive inverted corona (−5 kV)
were immersed for 20 min in these liquids, laid on an aluminum
plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The electrostatic
potentials measured for both rinsed surfaces are in the same
range as those obtained for untreated polyethylene films,

indicating that charge suppression or extraction was fairly
complete. On the other hand, water and hexane are not good
solvents for the charge carriers, since the PE surfaces still show
a significant residual electrostatic potential after rinsing with
these two liquids (see Figure 5a).
Contact angle of polyethylene top surface is almost restored

to initial value after the charged films are rinsed with butanol,
acetone, toluene, and chloroform, as shown in Figure 5b.
Nevertheless, when the rinsing solvents are ethanol, hexane,
and water, contact angles still remain significantly lower than
the those of untreated film, showing that these liquids cannot
fully extract the oxidized surface components.
In a set of experiments, polyethylene films were corona-

charged and rinsed with ethanol, and after that, the same film
was charged again. The charging/rinsing process was repeated
five times. Electrostatic potential on PE surface reveals that
charges are removed after each ethanol rinsing, but the film

treated again.
3.2. XPS and Microscopy. XPS spectra of top and bottom

polyethylene surfaces treated by inverted corona discharge (+5kV) were obtained and then compared to the untreated sample.
Carbon and oxygen elements are present in all samples, but
after corona treatment, the oxygen content on top surface
increases from 3% to 14%, while on the bottom surface, it is
unchanged.
Atomic force microscopy was used to observe surface

morphology on top and bottom polyethylene surfaces treated
by inverted corona discharge. Topography and phase contrast
images from different areas of both sides were simultaneously
acquired, and some representative micrographs are displayed in
Figures 6 and 7. Darker regions in phase contrast images
represent more rigid domains that are less able to dissipate
mechanical energy than the brighter areas.
Both sides of untreated polyethylene (Figures 6a,b and 7a,b)

are similar. Topography is fairly smooth with maximum height
ranging from 130 to 200 nm. Moreover, the corresponding
phase images present low contrast, showing that the untreated
polymer surface is chemically homogeneous (or, at least,
viscoelastically homogeneous). Following corona treatment, the
top surface layer is modified, as shown in Figure 6c−f: taller

rigid particles or granules protrude out of the substrate,
producing higher phase contrast.
Besides, the AFM micrographs reveal that grainy pattern

formation depends on corona discharge polarity. Under −5 kV
(Figure 6c,d), small rigid granules with 10−100 nm height are
produced. However, when the plate electrode voltage is positive
(Figure 6e,f), the surface is more extensively covered by rigid
particles (height from 10 to 65 nm).
Although the corona treatment causes morphological

changes in the top side of the polymer film, no significant
variation is observed in the bottom surface layer. Images from
the bottom side, obtained after positive (Figure 7c,d) and
negative (Figure 7e,f) inverted corona treatment, do not show
the granules observed in the upper surface, nor other new
morphology features.
Another important aspect shown by AFM images is that,

after ethanol rinsing of the sample shown in Figure 6e,f, most
granular rigid material formed during corona treatment is
removed (Figure 8), leaving the surface more even and soft.
Nevertheless, the morphology of the original surface is not fully
recovered.
The extracted material from the top surface of the corona-

treated polyethylene was analyzed by electron spectroscopy
imaging in the transmission electron microscopy (ESI-TEM). A
small volume (5 μL) of ethanol used to rinse the polymer
surface was deposited on TEM sample holder, and the solvent
was then allowed to dry at room temperature. Bright-field
images (Figure 9) reveal the presence of noncontinuous film
along the substrate as well as of dendritic material (see Figure
9c) formed by dewetting. Energy-loss spectra (Figure 9d)
present only two predominant peaks: one very intense at ca.
283 eV and a low intensity peak at ca. 540 eV. These peaks are
characteristic from carbon and oxygen, respectively, and they
confirm that the extracted material is oxidized.

4. DISCUSSION
Polyethylene films treated by inverted corona discharge acquire
large but opposite electrostatic potential on top and bottom
surfaces, thus forming a charge bilayer that can also be
described as a macroscopic dipole across the polymer film (see
Figure 1). Even though corona treatment has been used for
decades, the bilayer nature of the film was observed only
recently for the first time, and the involved mechanisms are not
yet understood, but the present results allow us to present a
model for charge bilayer formation.

Dipole Formation and Oxidation. Chemical and wetting
properties of the two surfaces are different; thus, the two poling
processes responsible for the surface charging are independent
and they can be separated, as verified in the sandwich
experiment (Figure 2). Moreover, the adsorbed bottom charges
are suppressed by a conducting layer previously evaporated on
the surface, leading to the formation of a charge monolayer that
levitates in an electric field.
In the present case, the bottom surface charging process

takes place within the space charge threshold established by
Montanari et al.35,36 According to these authors, LDPE poled
within a Laplacian field only acquires charge when the field is
higher than 10 kV/mm. The electric field experienced by the
sample due to the deposited charge on the upper surface is
about 20 kV/mm, above the threshold value.
The characterization of the charge carriers adopted by

Montanari et al.36 was done by evaluating the decay rate of
positive and negative charges injected into polyethylene

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901896 surfaces. When both depletion curves have the same profiles,
the charge carriers are of the same type (electrons and holes).
However, when the curves have different profiles, there are two
families of carriers (positive and negative ions or ions and
electrons/holes). Since the electrostatic potential half-lives of
bottom surfaces exposed to negative and positive corona
discharges are very different (Figure 4b), and electro-
luminescence experiments show that the electron/hole
injection in polyethylene films occurs only at very high electric
fields,37,38 we propose that the bottom charges are from two
families of carriers. Following Montanari criteria, they are
positive ions in negative corona treatment and negative ions in
positive corona treatment.
Surface charge excess that accounts for the measured

potentials in a positive discharge (see section 2.6) are +4.9 ×
10−10 C/cm2 and −3.5 × 10−10 C/cm2 for top and bottom
surfaces, respectively; thus, the excess value for the entire piece
is +1.4 × 10−10 C/cm2, lower but in the same order of
magnitude as the value obtained by direct charge measurement

(+3.8 × 10−10 C/cm2). Assuming that the charge carriers are
ions, we can estimate a concentration of only ca. 30 ions per
μm2. Even this low charge carrier concentration leads to high
electrostatic potentials, in excess of 1000 V on each surface.
The pronounced difference between the chemical composi-

tion, roughness, and wetting behavior of the two film surfaces
show that charge carriers at the bottom surface do not derive
from oxidized polymer. We suggest that they are formed by
adsorption of negative or positive water molecule cluster ions
from the atmosphere, due to the large potential gradient
created by the ions initially deposited on the surface exposed to
corona. The hypothesis of participation of atmospheric water in
insulator charging phenomena has already been extensively
verified in polymers and other materials, in many different
experimental situations,14,29−32 and the “sandwich” experiment
(Figure 2) provides another clear verification for it, since the
charge on the polymer at the interior of the three-sheet pile
cannot be assigned to implantation of corona ions or to
electron/hole injection from the plate electrode.

work, Xiao39 observed that the effect of different solvents on
the wetting behavior of corona-treated PE depends on the
solvent used. The present results show that this can be assigned
to the extraction of charged and oxidized polymer fragments.
Toluene, acetone, n-butanol, and chloroform are all more

effective than either water or n-hexane. By plotting the ion
efficiency removal as a function of Hildebrand’s parameter40 for
these liquids, a bell-shaped curve is obtained (Figure S4 of the
Supporting Information), as usual in phenomena dependent on
mutual miscibility between a polymer and a solvent. Using this
plot, we can estimate that the Hildebrand parameter for the
surface species is in the 18−23.5 MPa1/2 range. This broad
range is probably due to the complex nature of the extracted
material that is a mixture of oxidized oligo- and macroions.
Ethanol has a peculiar behavior: it effectively extracts the

charged species from PE surface but without increasing water
contact angle back to the original value. This shows that at least

part of the oxidized species formed on the polymer surface by
corona discharge are not ions.
In addition to the solubility parameter, solvent-rinsing

experiments revealed that the polar material extracted is only
found in the outermost surface layer, since all of the charge can
be removed without detectable change in film thickness, with a
1 μm resolution. Thus, a significant part of material produced
by corona treatment is only loosely anchored in the polymer
surface.

Modified Surface Morphology. Corona charging has a
pronounced effect on the morphology of the film surface
directly exposed to corona but not on the opposite surface that
is in contact with the flat electrode. Treated top surfaces show
many granules that are mechanically stiffer than the
surrounding polymer. The granular pattern on corona-treated
polyethylene and other polyolefin was previously reported in
the literature,41−43 and its formation depends on the exposure
time, temperature, and gas composition used during the
treatment.

loss spectrum of the extracted material.

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901899 Kim et al.41 suggested that granule formation is caused by the
degradation of the polyethylene molecules below an inert skin,
since the gas evolved during the degradation process may cause
the topmost skin to blister. Nevertheless, Overney et al.42 explained the occurrence of droplets considering the local
surface melting of degraded products formed during corona
treatment.
According to our results, both the size of the rigid granules

(Figure S5 of the Supporting Information) and the film charge
decrease with time, suggesting that the granules contain
charged species, thus explaining the low dissipative response
of the tip while scanning the granules. This behavior is
analogous to polyelectrolyte chains in solution under low ionic
strength, which are stiffer than neutral chains.44,45 Overney et
al.42 also verified by frictional force microscopy that these
granules are more rigid, but they did not associate their stiffness
to the presence of charge.
All these observations can be understood considering that

corona discharge under air chemically modifies adjacent PE
surfaces, oxidizing them and forming a modified polymer that is
expected to be immiscible with PE, since immiscibility is the
rule among polymers. For this reason, the pristine and modified
polymer tends to phase-separate. Beyond, since the surface
tension of the oxidized polymer is necessarily higher than PE
surface tension, the oxidized surface film cannot wet bare PE
and thus it retracts or dewets,46 forming the charged granules
that are extracted with some solvents. The mechanisms
involved in the positive inverted corona discharge treatment
are schematically represented in Figure 10. 5. CONCLUSION

Corona treatment of polyethylene film produces a host of
complex modifications not only in the surface directly exposed
to corona, but also in the opposite surface. The only feature
common to both surfaces is the large (but opposite)
electrostatic potential that transforms the film into a charged
bilayer. Otherwise, the chemical composition, wetting behavior,
morphology, and response to solvents of the two film surfaces
are completely different, pointing toward two different poling
mechanisms: deposition of corona atmospheric ions on one
surface followed by adsorption of oppositely charged water
molecule clusters on the opposite surface, under the field
created by the corona ions and other ions deriving from these.
The roughness on the polymer surface exposed to corona is
due to polymer−polymer immiscibility: oxidized and charged
PE dewets the unaltered polymer due to its high surface tension
forming domains stiffened by excess charge.

Received in final form 21 June 2004 Abstract—Oxygen plasma-treated quenched and annealed polypropylene (PP) films with different
crystallinities were investigated to characterize the surface rearrangement behavior during aging using
contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Optimum plasma conditions were
examined by varying the power, time and pressure. Less crystalline quenched PP showed a larger
increase in water contact angle and a larger decrease of oxygen atomic concentration during aging
than the more crystalline annealed PP, since the oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups, introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment, oriented towards or diffused faster into the bulk with lower crystallinity.
The degree of crosslinking on the surface was enhanced after plasma treatment and, in addition to
increased crystallinity, the crosslinked structure induced by plasma treatment restricted chain mobility
and lowered the aging rate of the PP surface.

Keywords: Plasma treatment; aging; surface rearrangement.

1. INTRODUCTION

Although polypropylene (PP) possesses good mechanical and chemical properties,
its use has been restricted in various applications owing to its low surface energy.
The interest in plasma modification of polymer surfaces has gradually increased in
the plastics industry for the last 30 years, since it can improve, e.g. the wettability,
adhesion, biocompatibility and printability [1–5]. Moreover, plasma treatment can
be carried out within only a few nanometers of the surface without altering the bulk
properties of the polymer.

Although the plasma treatment of polymers has become a mature technology,
research aimed at understanding the aging behavior of treated surfaces with time
of storage is still continuing. Enhanced hydrophilicity of the PP surface can
be obtained from hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl, which can be
introduced by oxygen plasma treatment. However, a commonly observed and
troublesome phenomenon is the deterioration of the beneficial surface properties
(hydrophilicity) with aging. Such an effect is easily manifested in contact-angle
measurements where one observes an increase in contact angle on long-term
storage. It has been suggested that this hydrophobic recovery is mainly due to two
processes [2, 5–7]: reorientation of polar chemical groups towards the bulk of the
material to reduce the surface energy, and the other is the diffusion of polar chemical
groups in the polymer matrix.

This aging behavior is usually strongly affected by environmental conditions.
High temperature helps the polymer chain to move freely and accelerate the surface
rearrangement. On the other hand, in a high humidity, the water molecules are
adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface and these water molecules disturb the rotation
or diffusion of polar groups [1, 2, 6].

The surface rearrangement due to reorientation and diffusion at the surface can
be reduced by limiting the mobility of polymer chains. The chain mobility mainly
occurs in an amorphous region and the mobility in a crystalline region is fairly
limited because of an orderly packed structure [8–11]. With highly crystalline
polymers, hydrophobic recovery would be reduced because the highly restricted
chain mobility in the crystalline region would hinder the rotational and translational
motions in the surface region after plasma treatment. Thus the restricted chain
mobility decreases the aging rate of the hydrophilic surface with a crystalline
polymer.

The surface changes after plasma treatment were investigated using X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact-angle measurements. The effect of
crystallinity on aging was studied with quenched and annealed PP. The degree of
crosslinking was examined after plasma treatment by measuring the gel content and
the effect of crosslink density on aging was also investigated.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.1. Materials

Isotactic polypropylene (PP, Mw 250 000) was supplied in the form of pellets by
Daehan Yuwha (Ulsan, South Korea). These pellets were pressed and formed into
thin sheets (0.5 mm) on stainless steel plates at 220◦C for 10 min with a mould
force of 50 kN. The molded sheets were then cleaned thoroughly in an ultrasonicator
using a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture for 20 min, dried using compressed air and stored
in a vacuum desiccator with 20% RH at room temperature.

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1281 2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Determination of crystallinity. The crystallization process was conducted
after molding the PP samples. To prepare low-crystallinity PP, molten PP films im-
mediately after molding were quenched into liquid nitrogen to reduce crystalliza-
tion of the polymer. Thermal treatment for a long time (24 h) at high temperature
(145◦C) was carried out to increase the degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity
of the above two PP samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) according to the standard procedure mentioned in the literature [12]. The
empirical heat of fusion for 100% crystalline PP was set at 187 J/g [13]. The crys-
tallinity was also obtained by wide-angle X-ray scattering spectra from X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD). As the crystallinity determined from DSC or XRD does not repre-
sent surface crystallinity, so surface crystallinity was determined using the grazing
incident angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) at 8C1 beamline of PAL (Pohang Accelera-
tion Laboratory). An incident angle of 0.1◦ was selected for GIXD and the depth of
penetration (τ ) at 0.1◦ grazing angle was calculated to be 100 nm from the following
equation [14]:

τ = sin2 θ − sin2 ψ

2µ sin θ cos ψ
(α = θ + ψ), (1) where α is the angle of incidence, θ is one-half the scattering angle, ψ is the tilt
angle and µ is the linear absorption coefficient. The crystallinities of quenched and
annealed PP obtained from DSC, XRD and GIXD are shown in Table 1. 2.2.2. Plasma treatment of PP samples. Cleaned PP samples were treated
with oxygen plasma using a home-made capacitively-coupled plasma generator
operating at 13.56 MHz. To obtain the optimum conditions (power, time and
pressure), plasma-generating conditions were varied and the following optimum
conditions were selected from the results of water contact-angle measurements:
power, pressure and treatment time of 110 W, 3.33 Pa (2.5 × 10−2 Torr) and
60 s, respectively. Following the plasma treatment, the samples were washed
ultrasonically in a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture to remove the low-molecular-weight

materials generated from chain scission and then dried. For the aging studies, the
samples were stored in desiccators for 30 days.

2.2.3. Contact-angle measurements. Contact-angle measurements on the
plasma-treated samples were performed at ambient temperature by the sessile drop
method with a contact-angle goniometer (CA-A, Kyowa Surface Science, Japan).
The equilibrium contact angle of water on untreated PP was found to be 100◦. An
average of at least six readings was reported in each case. The error limit in the
measurement of contact angle was around ±0.5◦. The contact angle of n-octane
in water was measured using the transparent glass cell and doubly bent needle as
shown in Fig. 1 to investigate the change in PP surfaces in the water environment.

2.2.4. XPS analysis. The chemical surface atomic composition of plasma-treated
polymer samples was investigated by XPS. The measurements were performed with
a Perkin-Elmer PHI-5400 Photoelectron Spectrometer using Mg Kα X-ray source
(1253.6 eV, 350 W). The C1s and O1s spectra of the samples were recorded with
0.2 eV interval energy. The C1s spectra of the untreated and oxygen plasma-treated
quenched PP are shown in Fig. 2. The operating pressure during analysis was in the
range of 10−9 Torr. Angle-resolved XPS measurements were carried out at take-off
angles of 20◦ (3.4 nm depth) and 90◦ (10 nm depth) for depth profiling of the treated
surfaces both before and after aging, and sampling depth for each take-off angle was
calculated from equation (2) [1, 16, 17]:

ζ = 3λ sin θ, (2) where ζ is the sampling depth, λ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) and θ is the
take-off angle. The mean free path of photoelectrons emitted from the samples was
calculated using equation (3):

λ = 0.11ρ−1E0.5k , (3) D

because it took 2 h to stabilize the pressure (below 10−9 Torr) in the main chamber.
C1s and O1s spectra were obtained after 1, 2, 13 and 30 days to observe the decay of
oxygen containing species on the surface. Atomic concentration of oxygen (Coxygen)

The carbon (Acarbon) and oxygen (Aoxygen) areas were calculated using the PC
software, ‘PeakFit’, and the atomic sensitivity factors (S) based on peak area
measurement were taken as 0.296 for C1s and 0.711 for O1s to normalize the
intensities of the signals [18].

2.2.5. Measurement of gel content. Gel content was measured before and after
oxygen plasma treatment. PP films trapped in the mesh basket made of stainless
steel wire were dissolved in hot naphthalene (170◦C) for 12 h according to ASTM
D 2765. The residual weight of PP in the mesh was measured, and since this
residue was mainly from the crosslinked structures, the degree of crosslinking was
determined from the gel content.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Plasma process conditions

Power, time and pressure are important factors which affect the hydrophilicity of
polymer samples, because the density and the energy of ions impinging on the
sample surface depend on these parameters [19–21]. Figure 3 shows the water
contact angles on oxygen plasma-treated PP under various treatment powers and
times at 3.33 Pa. To obtain the lowest water contact angle, meaning the highest

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1285 hydrophilicity of surface, a longer time or high power was required. As the
treatment time decreased, more power was needed to obtain a water contact angle
under 10 degrees. Low power cannot generate high density of ions with an energy
higher than the bond energy of C H to generate radicals on the PP surface and,
thus, longer treatment time can increase the number of radicals.

The effect of pressure on the oxygen plasma treatment of PP is shown in the
Fig. 4 with 100 W for 2 min. The water contact angle decreased as the pressure
dropped and the lowest water contact angle was observed at 3.33 Pa. At lower
chamber pressures, the mean free paths of the ions and electrons are longer, and
the ions can strike the surface with a relatively low loss of kinetic energy. At
high pressure, however, the intensity of collisions between the ions and the neutral
molecules increases, with the particles losing kinetic energy before colliding with
the surface, resulting in low generation of radicals [21]. Below the pressure of
3.33 Pa, the water contact angle increased, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. At too
low pressure, the number of particles (neutral molecules) is low and the generation
of ions is little, since ions are generated from the collision of electrons with neutral
molecules. Even if the ions strike the surface of the polymer without loss of kinetic
energy, the number of collisions between the ions and the surface is not high and
there are not enough radicals formed on the surfaces.

From the above experiment, 3.33 Pa pressure, 1 min time and 110 W Rf power
were chosen as optimum process conditions and all oxygen plasma treatments were
carried out under these conditions.

3.2. XPS results

The surfaces of the oxygen plasma treated PP samples were characterized with XPS
(Fig. 5). Before aging, the oxygen concentration of the surface with 20◦ take-off
angle (approx. 3.4 nm depth) was 10% more than that of the surface with 90◦ take-
off angle (approx. 10 nm). The decrease of oxygen concentration with increasing
depth from the surface reveals that reactions of polymer chains with oxygen plasma
occurred in a very shallow surface region. For the generation of oxygen species,
carbon radicals had to be formed by the accelerated oxygen ions in the plasma and
reaction with the molecular oxygen. Since the oxygen ions could not penetrate
into the deep surface region and the molecular oxygen could not diffuse into the
bulk layer easily, the oxygen concentration of the oxygen plasma-treated PP surface
decreased with increasing take-off angle.

Annealed PP, having higher crystalline fraction, had lower concentration of
atomic oxygen than quenched PP having lower crystalline fraction. The higher
degree of oxygenation of the low crystalline sample indicates a greater chemical
reactivity of the sample with plasma. It appeared that the reaction intermediates

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1287 (mainly the radicals) were relatively more mobile in the polymer matrix having
lower crystalline fraction and, hence, are expected to react more easily with the
oxygen ions in the plasma [22]. Morra et al. have reported the influence of
crystallinity on the plasma modification of the polymer surface [5]. They concluded
that higher reactivity of the polymer, having lower crystalline fraction, was due to
greater freedom of motion granted by higher percentage of amorphous domains of
the polymer.

During aging, both quenched and annealed PP samples showed similar decrease
of oxygen concentration and the change was not much in the sampling depth of
10 nm (90◦ take-off angle). After 30 days of aging there was 8% decrease in oxygen
concentration with quenched PP, but only 4% decrease with annealed PP in the
sampling depth of 3.4 nm (20◦ take-off angle). This represents, that in the surface
depth around 3.4 nm, the migration of polar functional groups of the annealed PP
is much reduced due to higher crystallinity. Increase in crystallinity hinders the
movement of the polymer chains and, therefore, slows down the aging process due
to higher structural regularity and lower free volume in the polymer matrix [8, 23].

3.3. Contact angle variation with aging

As shown in Fig. 6, an increase of water contact angle on oxygen plasma-treated PP
was observed during aging in air. The modified hydrophilic polymer surface after
oxygen plasma treatment became hydrophobic again to reduce the interfacial free

energy between the surface and its environment. Hydrophilic groups introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment oriented towards or diffused into the bulk, and the
surface became hydrophobic. In the water condition, however, the surface of oxygen
plasma-treated PP was stable, since the difference in interfacial energy was not
high. Before oxygen plasma treatment, because PP was originally hydrophobic,
the contact angle of n-octane having similar surface energy as PP was low. But the
contact angle of n-octane was high after plasma treatment and it stayed constant
during aging in the water condition. In water, the hydrophilic groups formed by
plasma treatment did not reorient towards or diffuse into the bulk. The slight
decrease of contact angle of n-octane after 1 day aging was due to dissolution of
low-molecular-weight materials (LMWM) formed by plasma treatment. The loss
of LMWM having hydrophilic groups on the surface decreased the surface energy
of PP and hence the contact angle of n-octane.

From water contact angle measurements the amount of polar groups formed can
be estimated in the surface region (depth 0.5 nm) after plasma treatment [24, 25].
Although the contact angles on quenched and annealed PP were almost the same
(10◦) just after plasma treatment, there was more increase with less crystalline,
quenched PP during aging, as shown in Fig. 7. The increase was smaller for the
more crystalline, annealed PP and the retention of hydrophilicity was also relatively
high. The increase of contact angles after aging was interpreted as a result of
migration of polar groups away from the surface to the bulk (depth 0.5 nm). The

sharp increase of contact angle within 24 h was similar to the sharp decay of atomic
oxygen concentration determined from XPS in the depth of 3 nm.

The fraction of immobile polar groups (fim) was calculated using the equation
suggested by Hyun, and the fim values are shown in Table 2 [11]. Chatelier
et al. have defined ‘immobile’ polar groups as those that cannot participate in
polymer chain motions transporting the polar groups beyond the range of interfacial
potentials [24]. The polymer surface with a higher fim persisted to have a low
contact angle after long periods of aging due to the restricted polymer chain
movement in the well-ordered crystalline region. From the fim value of oxygen
plasma-treated PP, it was observed that the amount of immobile polar groups
(fim) of annealed PP was higher than those of quenched PP due to higher surface
crystallinity. These immobile polar groups with limited movement caused a low
rate of decay of oxygen containing species with more crystalline PP in the XPS
experiment. The decrease of hydrophobic recovery with the increase of crystallinity
is due to the restriction imposed on the loss of polar surface groups by the ordered
crystalline environment.

3.4. Crosslinking after plasma treatment

In spite of the difference in crystallinity more than 10% between annealed and
quenched PP, the more crystalline PP had only 5◦ lower water contact angle and
2% higher oxygen atomic concentration after 30 days aging. Also the fraction of
the immobile polar groups of more crystalline PP was not much more than that of
less crystalline PP. If the crystallinity was the only factor affecting the mobility
of polymer chains, the differences in water contact angle and oxygen atomic
concentration between quenched and annealed PP after aging would be much larger.
Therefore, we measured the gel content change after oxygen plasma treatment
(Table 3), and observed that the degree of crosslinking of less crystalline PP was
higher than that of more crystalline PP. Usually the formation of a three-dimensional
network is a well-known consequence of a polymer by inert gas plasma treatment,
and the reaction mechanisms were illustrated by Poncin-Epaillard and co-workers as
shown in Fig. 8 [27, 28]. The combination of radicals obtained after elimination of
CH3 could form the crosslinked structure. A higher degree of crosslinking formed in

low crystallinity PP limited the mobility of chains and, thus, reduced the difference
in surface rearrangements between low and high crystallinity PP.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The surface rearrangement of polypropylene (PP) having different crystallnities was
studied after oxygen plasma treatment using XPS and contact-angle measurements.
Less crystalline PP had a higher susceptibility to attack by plasma and had a higher
oxygen concentration on the surface because of the more amorphous fraction on
its surface. But during aging, the more crystalline PP had lower water contact
angle and higher oxygen concentration than the less crystalline PP. The mobility
of polar groups was reduced with increase of degree of crystallinity. After oxygen
plasma treatment, an enhancement of crosslinking was observed and the crosslinked
structure on the surface limited the reorientation and diffusion of polar functional
groups into the bulk.

The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the “heterogeneity” in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.   

1. Introduction 

Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1–5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, e.g., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, etc. [6–11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12–15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called ‘percolation threshold’ [16–18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19–21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22–24]. 

The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25–27]. 
Luo et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28–32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (λ⊥) of 5.5 W/m⋅K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
but a high λ⊥ of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (e.g., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ//) and a limited λ⊥ [33–35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the λ⊥ of the composites [36]. 

For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37–40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 

date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical “probe” detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials and sample preparation 

Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 μm and a thickness of 
~0.26 μm (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 μm is purchased from Ya’an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 ◦C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 ◦C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 ◦C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 

2.2. Characterizations 

The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 ◦C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 ◦C to 650 ◦C in a N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 ◦C 
with 10 ◦C/min from 30 ◦C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate 
thermal history. Then, the samples were cooled to 30 ◦C at a heating rate 
of 10 ◦C/min, followed by heating again to 220 ◦C.

The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 ◦C oven for 4 h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-Kα ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 Å. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5–50 o. 

3. Results 

To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (λ⊥), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 

The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 ◦C. Fig. 2a–d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, i.e., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The λ⊥
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both λ⊥ at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent λ⊥ (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m⋅K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m⋅K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 

As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (Tm) and crystallinity (Xc) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: Tm = 166.4 ◦C, Xc = 29.6%; the distal end: Tm = 166.9 ◦C, Xc =

28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 

To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of λ⊥ and the 

heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5◦ is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 

To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in λ⊥ and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, L1/L2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of L1/L2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of L1/L2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

Notably, the value of L1/L2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 

flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and λ⊥) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 

In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a–d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the λ⊥ of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the “dilution” 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of λ⊥ between the proximal and distal position (Δλ⊥/λ⊥) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The Δλ⊥/λ⊥ values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will “disturb” 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the λ⊥ of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites. 

4. Discussion 

In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44–48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a “cold” 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 

During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly “freezes” when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 

During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

platelets within PP/FG composites.

FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 

The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm–8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(e.g., injection pressure, mold temperature, etc.) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future. 

5. Conclusion 

In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.

Decreased Thermal Conductivity
of Polyethylene Chain Influenced
by Short Chain Branching
In this paper, we have studied the effect of short branches (side chains) on the thermal
conductivity (TC) of a polyethylene (PE) chain. With a reverse nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics (RNEMD) method, TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are
simulated and compared. It shows that the branch has a positive effect to decrease the
TC of a PE chain. The TC of the PE-ethyl chain decreases with the number density
increase of branches, until the density becomes larger than about eight ethyl per 200 seg-
ments, where the TC saturates to be only about 40% that of a pristine PE chain. Because
of different weights, different branches will cause a different decrease of TCs, and a
heavy branch will lead to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

1 Introduction

Not only a high thermal conductivity (TC) but also a quite low
TC is desired for polymers because of their wide applications
[1–6], such as a high TC for application as a thermal interface
material [7,8] and a low TC for application as a thermal insulation
material. Single polymer chains and highly aligned polymer fibers
have attracted a wide attention due to their potential high TC
[9–16]. Although a single polymer chain may possess a high TC,
polymers are generally regarded as a thermal insulator because of
their very low thermal conductivities on the order of 0.1 W m1 K1 [17]. One of the reasons for the low TC is that the polymer
chains are randomly coiled in the polymers, which effectively
shortens the mean free path (MFP) of heat-carrying phonons
[18,19]. Another reason is that the TC of these polymers can be
significantly influenced by the morphology of individual chains
[14–17,20–22]. Besides these two reasons, the method to further
decrease the TC of a polymer is still desired to develop a thermal
insulator.

There have already been some methods to reduce the TC of a
polymer chain. Liao et al. [23] tuned the TC of a polymer chain
by atomic mass modifications and found that heavy substituents
hinder heat transport substantially. Robbins and Minnich [16]found that even perfectly crystalline polynorbornene has an
exceptionally low TC near the amorphous limit due to extremely
strong anharmonic scattering. Most recently, Ma and Tian [24]studied the influence of the side chains on the TC of bottlebrush
polymers, and predicted that side chains dominate the heat con-
duction and could lead to a lower TC. Some other studies also
shown that chain segment disorder, or the random rotations of
segments in a chain, will lead to a lower TC [15,25–28].

In this paper, we take the effect of branches into account to
probe a way to reduce the TC of a polymer. Considering the com-
plex structure of a polymer, we just focus on the polyethylene
(PE) chain. Results turn out that the TC of a PE chain with
branches can be decreased to be only 40% that of a pristine chain.
The paper is organized as follows: first, a reverse nonequilibrium

molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method is introduced; and then
the effects of backbone chain length, branching chain location,
branching chain type, and the number density of branching chains
are simulated and discussed. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

2 Simulation Method

The materials studio is applied to build the initial configuration
of the PE chain and the modified PE chain. The PE chain is estab-
lished by replicating the PE segments which is the unit cell of
PE’s idealized bulk lattice structure with a length of 2.507 Å. The
schematic structures of a pristine PE chain and a PE-ethyl chain
are shown in Fig. 1. After building the PE chain, with the COM-
PASS II potential [29–32], we first relax the system in an NVT
(constant number of atoms, temperature, and volume) ensemble at
a temperature of 300 K for 125 ps, where the Nose–Hoover ther-
mostat [33,34] is applied to obtain the constant temperature. And
then, a NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy)
ensemble is used to release the thermal stress. In the simulation
process, we double-check that the total energy has reached mini-
mum and becomes unchangeable at the end of NVT and NVE
ensembles to make sure that our systems have already been
equilibrated.

To calculate TC, the RNEMD [35,36] simulation is performed
on the well equilibrated structures to establish a temperature gra-
dient. In the RNEMD method, each of the simulation boxes is
divided into several slabs with a periodic boundary in the heat
transfer direction. As that shown in Fig. 2, the simulation system
is divided into several slabs (20 to 200 slabs, depending on the
chain length), slab 0 is the “hot” slab, and the slab N/2 is the
“cold” slab. Other slabs are used to obtain the temperature distri-
butions. The heat flux is created by exchanging velocities of par-
ticles in cold and hot slabs. The cold slab donates its “hottest”
particles (particles with the highest kinetic energy) to the hot slab
in exchange for the latter’s “coolest” particles (particles with the
lowest kinetic energy). Performing this exchange periodically
results in the heating up of the hot slab and cooling down of the
cold slab. This process eventually yields a steady-state tempera-
ture gradient due to thermal conduction through slabs separating
the cold and hot slabs. The TC is calculated exactly by the
relationship

the cross-sectional area which is selected to be 14.7 Å2 with a
branch-caused uncertainty less than 1.6% as listed in Table 1.Such a small difference between cross-sectional areas will not
lead to a large TC difference as that caused by branches (will be
discussed later). The TC present in this work could be scaled by a
different cross-sectional area for a comparison. With a time-step

of 1 fs, a total simulation time of 0.1 ns is taken to get a good lin-
ear temperature distribution. The temperature which is adopted to
calculate the temperature gradient is averaged through every 1000simulation steps (1 ps). The temperature fluctuation in the simula-
tion can be reduced by this average method. With heat flux printed
out every 0.1 ps, the TC is calculated at the last step. The tempera-
ture distribution in a PE chain with a length of 100 segments is
shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The linear temperature region is
fitted to obtain the temperature gradient for the calculation of the
effective TC by using the Fourier’s law. The TC calculated at dif-
ferent simulation times is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that 0.1 ns is
long enough to get a converged TC.

3 Results and Discussion

First, the length dependence of the TC of a pristine PE chain is
investigated and compared with that in early researches. And
then, the TC of the pristine PE chains with different lengths is
compared with that of a PE-ethyl chain. Third, the effect of the
branch arrangement is considered. Finally, the influence of the
branch type and the number density of branches are taken into
account.

3.1 Length Dependence of TC. Thermal conductivities of
the pristine PE chain with different chain lengths at 300 K are first
simulated and presented in Fig. 4(a). Previous works [14,37,38]about the pristine PE chains are also added in Fig. 4(a) for com-
parison. As that shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an obvious increase of
the TC with the increase of the chain length. Even with the length
increasing to be 200 nm, the TC still not converges, which sug-
gests that some portion of the phonons can still travel ballistically

in such a length. Our simulation work confirms that the TC of a
pristine PE chain will increase with the increasing number of seg-
ments (or chain length), and the TC of a single PE chain is several
orders of magnitude larger than that of a PE polymer. In Fig. 4(a),
the TC difference between different works should be attributed to
the application of different simulation methods, considering that
the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method is applied in our
and the work of Hu et al. and the equilibrium molecular dynamics
method is utilized in the work of Ni et al. and Liu and Yang. It
seems that a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method will
give a higher TC than an equilibrium molecular dynamics method.
This was also noticed in other studies [39,40], and some explana-
tions can be found there.

Plotting 1/k against 1/L in Fig. 4(b), we can see that with the
increase of 1/L, the 1/k first increases rapidly and then saturates to
a linear increase. The method by extrapolating the linear relation-
ship between the inverse of the TC (1/k) and the inverse of the
sample length (1/L) to get the TC with an infinite length fails.
This failure is attributed to the divergent thermal conductivity at
1/L! 0 where 1/k! 0, which has already been carefully studied
and explained with theoretical and molecular dynamics methods
in Ref. [41], more details can be found there.

Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain and the PE-
ethyl chain with lengths ranging from 100 to 500 segments (or
25.07–125.35 nm) are compared in Fig. 5. It turns out that both
TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain increase with
the increasing length, and the TC of a PE-ethyl chain is only about
75% that of a pristine PE chain. To illustrate the underlying mech-
anism of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain, the vibrational den-
sity of states (VDOS) is calculated by using the Fourier transform

of the velocity autocorrelation function. Results are compared
between the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain with 50 seg-
ments, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering the low-frequency
(<20 THz) phonons dominate the TC due to their high group
velocities and long MFPs [23], the lower VDOS of the PE-ethyl
chain in the low frequency should be responsible for the lower
TC, where the branch acts as a center of low-frequency-phonon
scattering.

To further illustrate the phonon scattering caused by the branch-
ing chains, the phonon spectral energy density (SED) of the pris-
tine PE and PE-ethyl chains is calculated based on the velocity
output of MD simulations. The atomic velocities are obtained by a
NVE simulation at a temperature of 300 K. The frequency resolu-
tion is selected to be 0.01 THz with 0.1 ns NVE simulations, and
the wave-number is 0.02j/(2p/a), where j¼ 2pn/aN, here a is the
lattice constant, N is the total number of unit cells along the heat
transfer direction (N¼ 50 in this work), and n is an integer ranging
from 0 to N 1. More details about the calculation can be found
in Refs. [42–45]. Results are shown in Fig. 7 with the shading sig-
nifying the magnitude of the SED. The SED of a pristine PE chain
in Fig. 7(a) coincides with that in Ref. [16] which confirms the
reliability of our calculation. For each phonon mode in Fig. 7, the
range of frequencies is related to the anharmonicity of the poten-
tial and the rate of the phonon scattering. The situation when
branch atoms move far away from equilibrium positions may lead
to a significant broadening of the peaks in Fig. 7. Fitting the shape
of peak and valley profiles of SED at all branches to the Lorent-
zian function [42–45], the phonon relaxation time is obtained and
shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the magnitude of the phonon relaxa-
tion time is greatly reduced by branching chains, which should be

responsible for the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain. The redistribu-
tion of phonons and the smearing acoustic branches of the
PE-ethyl chain in Fig. 7(b) proves the result in Fig. 8 that there is
a more severe phonon scattering for a PE-ethyl chain than a pris-
tine PE chain.

3.2 Influence of Branch Arrangements. The influence of
branch locations is considered in this part. For a pristine PE chain,
there are different locations from the simulation region boundary
to the branching ethyl. Five special locations are selected to
branch a short chain, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respec-
tively, as that shown in Fig. 9(a). The result in Fig. 9(b) confirms
that the presence of a branching chain can truly reduce the TC,
and the average TC of a PE-ethyl chain is about 0.7 times that of a
pristine PE chain. Our simulations also indicate that there is
almost a same TC for different locations in Fig. 9(b). This is
attributed to the periodic boundary condition in the simulation.
The small TC discrepancies between different locations should be
caused by the different distance of the branch from the simulation
boundary. If the boundary and the branching chains are both
thought as defects on a pristine PE chain, the TC with ethyl
located at the middle of the chain (P1) will be lower than other
TCs (P2, P3, P4, and P5), because of the small distance from the

middle of the chain to the system boundary. This is confirmed by
results in Fig. 9(b).

3.3 Influence of Branching Chain Types and Number Den-
sity of Branches. Seven different types of short chains are
branched on the middle segment of a PE chain, respectively, for
comparisons. They are different from the weight and the type of
chemical bonds between the backbone and the branch, as shown
in Fig. 10, which are listed as phenoxy group, phenyl group,
ethoxy group, methoxy group, ethyl group, ethylene group, and
hydroxy group, respectively. The black, red, and blue columns in
Fig. 10 stand for different chain lengths. The relative masses of
different branches are also shown in Fig. 10. We can see that all
types of branches can lead to a decrease of TC, and a heavy
branch leads to a lower TC than a light one, except for the ethyl-
ene group for which TC may be further decreased by a different
bond. It agrees with the conclusion in Ref. [23] that a chain modi-
fied by a heave atom possesses a lower TC than that modified by a
light one, where the modifying atom can be thought a special
short branch. We conclude that different branches will lead to a
different decrease of thermal conductivities because of the differ-
ent weights. More studies are still needed to probe the effect of
bonds between the backbone and the branch on the TC.

The effect of the number density of branches is studied in this
part. The number density of branches is defined as the number of
branches divided by the number of PE segments. Two hundred
segments (50.14 nm) are applied as a periodic unit in the simula-
tion, and the ethyl group is selected as the branch. Considering
there are different locations on a PE chain to branch an ethyl
group, we only consider two special location arrangements, i.e.,
the aligned arrangement and the fork arrangement, as that shown
in Fig. 11(a). For the aligned arrangement of ten branching ethyl,
they are equally distributed on the PE chain, only a part of the
chain is shown in Fig. 11(a); for the fork arrangement of ten
branching ethyl, every two branching ethyl are located at the same
segment of the PE chain, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). The corre-
sponding TC of these two arrangements is shown in Fig. 11(b). It
shows that a larger number density of branches leads to a lower
TC for both arrangements. With an increase of the number density
of branches, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain finally converges to be
only about 40% that of the pristine PE chain. This can be under-
stood by that with the increase of the number density, the distance
between branches is reduced, and the long-MFP phonons will be
decreased until the TC converges to a constant value. It can be
predicted that if a PE-ethyl chain instead of a pristine PE chain is
used to build up a polymer, the TC of the polymer will be much
reduced, because of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain and the
additional mass of branches. What kind of a chain will lead to a
lower TC is the key point of this paper, and more studies are still
needed to figure out the effect of long branches on the TC of a
pristine chain [24].

4 Conclusions

It is desirable to further reduce the TC of a polymer for devel-
oping a thermal insulation material. In this paper, we take
branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a chain.
With the RNEMD method, the TCs of the pristine PE chain and
the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. Influences of the
chain length, branch arrangements, types, and number density of
branches are considered. Our results suggest that the branch has a
positive effect to reduce the TC of a PE chain. If the number den-
sity of ethyl branches becomes larger than eight ethyls per 200segments, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain converges to be only about
40% that of a pristine PE chain. This conclusion will not be influ-
enced by the branch arrangements. Different branches cause a dif-
ferent decrease of thermal conductivities because of their different
weights, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one.
This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to
obtain a polymer with a low TC.

Nature 2018 ABSTRACT

The crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers and molecular orientation of

polymer have long been considered to be significant influencing factors on the

thermal conductivity of polymer materials, but more clear-cut understanding on

their impact on the thermal conductivity is still needed. In this work, poly-L-

lactide (PLLA), whose crystallinity and orientation can be adjusted in a wide

range, is selected to discuss the effect of degree of crystallinity and orientation

on the thermal conductivity of PLLA. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature

on the thermal conductivity is also discussed. PLLA compression-molded

samples were heat-treated at 120 C to tune the crystallinity of the samples,

while the degrees of orientation were tuned by stretching the amorphous PLLA

bars at 60 C to different strains. It is found that environmental temperature of

application affects the thermal conductivity obviously and the glass transition

temperature of polymers shows a strong influence on the thermal conductivity

of PLLA. Below Tg, the thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature and when the temperature is higher than Tg, the

thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity decreases remarkably.

It is also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of PLLA increases with the

increase in crystallinity, and the tensile strain linearly increases the thermal

conductivity in the direction of molecular orientation and decreases the thermal

conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which are in agreement with other

semicrystalline polymers that has been reported.

Introduction

With the rapid development of science and tech-

nologies, electric products are more and more highly

integrated, which urgently pushes the exploitation of

effective thermal management materials including

thermally conductive polymers and polymer com-

posites to be applied in various applications [1–7],

such as packaging, electronic devices and energy

storage. However, bulk polymers generally exhibit

very low thermal conductivity (TC) in the range of

0.1–0.5 W/(mK) [8, 9], so the development of poly-

mer materials with enhanced thermal conductivity

has become a great challenge to meet great increasing

demands [10–15]. It has been accepted that the

polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the overall TC

of polymer composites [16]. It is therefore necessary

to clearly clarify the influence of important factors

such as crystallinity and molecular orientation on the

TC of polymers.

Generally, crystalline polymers exhibit higher TC

than amorphous polymers due to the ordered struc-

ture, while the random chain conformation in amor-

phous polymers reduces the phonon mean free path

and causes phonon scattering [17]. In early study,

Hansen et al. [18] reported that the TC of high density

polyethylene can be improved by increasing the

crystallinity and lamellar thickness via tuning pro-

cessing conditions. Subsequently, Choy and co-

worker [19] found that the influence of crystallinity

on the TC of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was

affected by temperature. The TC of PET decreases

with increasing crystallinity at low temperature, but

increases with crystallinity at temperatures above

30 K. The peculiar behavior was interpreted from the

increasing thermal boundary resistance due to

acoustic mismatch at amorphous–crystalline interface

when the temperature is lowered. Crystallization was

also reported to be responsible for the higher TC in

other semicrystalline polymers [20, 21]. The higher

the crystallinity, the higher the thermal conductivity.

As heat transports more easily along polymer

chains than perpendicular to the polymer chain,

polymers exhibit significant anisotropy in their ther-

mally conductive properties [22]. Numerous experi-

mental studies on polymer chain orientation for TC

enhancement have been reported. As a typical

semicrystalline polymer, polyethylene (PE) has been

mostly used to study the effect of orientation on TC

[18, 23–28]. TC of other semicrystalline polymers

stretched to different draw ratio including poly-

oxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP),

polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET was also

studied [29]. The general result is that TC parallel to

the orientation direction rapidly increases with

increasing strain or draw ratio, while TC perpendic-

ular to the orientation direction decreases slightly.

But in these studies on the effect of the orientation,

TC was also influenced by the crystallization nature

of the polymers. To clarify how chain alignment

affects TC during drawing, purely amorphous poly-

mers were studied [30–34]. Early studies [31, 32] showed that the TC of stretched polymethyl

methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can be

increased in the stretching direction, but the increase

was small. However, it was found recently that

polythiophene nanofibers can achieve a TC up to

4.4 W/(m K), more than 20 times greater than the

bulk polymer through chain alignment [34]. Lu et al.

[35] also evidenced the molecular alignment in

amorphous region played a very important role in

the enhancement of thermal conductivity of

semicrystalline polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber.

PLLA is a plant-derived biodegradable polymer

material. However, low thermal conductivity restricts

its application in engineering and electronic fields. To

expand the applications of PLLA, many studies have

been conducted to improve the TC of PLLA via

compounding with thermally conductive fillers

[36–41], but the basic influencing factors from the

polymer itself have not been well addressed, which is

hopefully to provide supporting for fabrication of

high thermally conductive PLLA composites. Also,

owing to that PLLA exhibits very low crystallization

kinetics [42–44], the amorphous state by quenching

and a wide range of degrees of crystallinity by

isothermal crystallization at different temperature for

different periods of time can be easily achieved [45].

These features provide a good candidate to elucidate

the effect of crystallinity and molecular orientation on

the TC of semicrystalline polymers.

In this study, the crystallinity of PLLA was tuned

by melt crystallization at 120 C for different minutes.

Various degrees of orientation of PLLA were realized

by stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C with

the same speed to different strains. WAXD was car-

ried out to characterize the crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA. DSC, density measurement and

laser flash method were performed together to reveal

10544 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 the relation between TC and crystallinity, tempera-

ture and orientation of molecular chains. The results

showed that TC of PLLA with different crystallinity

was affected obviously by ambient temperature and

the maximum value appeared at Tg. TC of PLLA

increases with increasing crystallinity, and TC of

PLLA parallel to the orientation direction increases

with increasing tensile strain, while the one perpen-

dicular to the stretching direction decreases with

increasing strain. These results can further manifest

the effect of crystallinity and orientation on the

thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers.

Also, this systematic study can provide supporting

for fabricating enhanced thermally conductive PLLA

composites.

Experimental section

Materials and sample preparation

PLLA (trade name 4032D, Nature Works LLC) was

used. The average weight molecular weight (Mw) and

the polydispersity index (PDI) are 2.1 9 105 g/mol

and 1.7. The melting temperature is 167.2 C, mea-

sured by differential scanning calorimetry at a heat-

ing rate of 10 C/min.

PLLA granules were dried in a blast drying oven at

60 C for 12 h, and then melted in the mixer of a

torque rheometer with a rotational speed of 50 rpm at

190 C for 5 min. After that, the resulted materials

were compressed into sheets with the thickness of

about 0.5 mm at 190 C for 3 min under a pressure of

10 MPa. The melted PLLA sheet was immediately

transferred to isothermal crystallization at 120 C for

different minutes (0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 40 min)

under a pressure of 10 MPa and then cooled quickly

to obtain samples with different crystallinity. The

resulted samples were designated as 120-X min, in

which X stands for the compression time at 120 C.
Round disks with the diameter of 12.7 mm were cut

from the 120-X min PLLA sheets for WAXD and

thermal diffusivity tests. Rectangular-shaped sample

bars with the dimension of 20 mm (width) 9 80.0 mm (length) were cut from amorphous 120-0 min

PLLA sheets, and then stretched uniaxially at 60 C
using an Instron 5967 universal material testing

machine at a stretching rate of 20 mm/min. The

tensile strain was controlled to be 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The stretched bars designated as 60-20-Y, in which

Y stands for the tensile strain, were measured by 2D wide angel X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to determine

the degree orientation. Both the through-plane and

in-plane thermal diffusivities of the stretched bars

were tested.

Characterization

WAXD measurements and data analysis

WAXD measurement of PLLA compression sheets

isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different min-

utes was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffrac-

tometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k = 0.154 nm,

40 kV, 25 mA) in the scanning range of 2h = 5–60 at
a scan speed of 10/min at room temperature. The

crystallinity was determined from the fractional area

of the crystalline peaks to the total area [46].

WAXD measurement of PLLA samples stretched to

different strains at 60 C with the speed of 20 mm/

min was carried out on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER 2D X-ray diffractometer with the reflection mode. The

X-ray was generated using ImS micro Focus X-ray

source generator with Cu target (k = 0.154 nm, 40 kV,

40 mA). The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns were

recorded on a VANTEC-500 detector system with a

pixel size of 68 9 68 mm2. The distance from the

sample to detector was 198 mm. The spot size of the

beam was 0.5 mm.

Density measurement

The density of PLLA compression-molded samples

with different crystallinity was measured by using

MH-120E density meter according to Archimedes

principle.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement

The empty pan, sapphire standard and PLLA com-

pression-molded samples with different crystallinity

were measured by DSC (Q20, TA company). Samples

were measured from - 80 to 90 C with heating rate

of 10 C/min under nitrogen gas flow of 50 mL/min.

Thermal conductivity measurement by laser flash method

The sample preparation processes for the thermal

diffusivity measurements are outlined in Fig. S1. Before testing, the thickness and length or diameter

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10545 of the samples were measured, and then both sur-

faces of the samples were evenly sprayed with a thin

graphite layer. The sample was then fixed according

to the required test pattern and placed in the test

chamber (LFA 467, Netzsch). PLLA compression-

molded samples with different crystallinity were

tested in the temperature ranging from - 70 to 80 C,
while the PLLA stretched samples with different

Effect of temperature and crystallinity
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

WAXD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sam-

ples isothermally crystallized at 120 C for different

period of time are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that

the quenched PLLA compression-molded sample

without isothermal crystallization (120-0 min) shows

only a very broad diffraction peak of amorphous

phase without any traces of crystalline peaks, clearly

showing the amorphous nature of the sample owing

to the extremely slow crystallization kinetics of

PLLA. After isothermal crystallizing at 120 C, the
WAXD profile of the isothermally crystallized PLLA

samples shows three peaks at 2h = 16.7, 19.0 and

22.3, respectively, corresponding to the diffraction

peaks of (200)/(110), (203) and (015) planes of a
crystalline structure of PLLA. The diffraction inten-

sity of the peaks increases with the extension of

isothermal crystallization time, showing that

isothermal treatment at 120 C can effectively pro-

mote the crystallization of PLLA. By Gauss fitting of

the WAXD profiles, the crystallinity of all the samples

was calculated and is listed in Table 1. The results

demonstrate that the crystallinity of PLLA isother-

mally crystallized at 120 C increases with the

extension of isothermal crystallizing time, and can

even reach up to a level higher than 50%.

The different crystallinity of PLLA samples leads to

the differences of densities, which are listed in

Table 2. It can be seen that although the crystallinity

varies in a great range after crystallizing at 120 C for

different time, the change in density, showing a slight

increasing trends, is quite limited. However, when

the crystallinity increases, the ratio of the ordered

molecular chains in the system increases, leading to

the decrease in the volume of the sample. That is why

the density of PLLA increases a little with the

increasing of crystallinity.

The specific heat (Cp) was obtained by DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, America) at a heating rate of 10 C/
min. The Cp values of PLLA compression samples

with different crystallinity are calculated by Eq. (1):

Cp ¼ Cp0m0h= mHð Þ ð1Þ where Cp and Cp0, m and m0, h and H are the specific

heat, the weight and the heat flow of PLLA sample

and sapphire standard, respectively. The specific heat

of sapphire standard is given in the DSC software.

The calculated specific heat of PLLA samples is

shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the specific heat

increases linearly before 50 C. An abrupt increase in

the specific heat is observed in the glass transition

temperature range (50–70 C), resulting from the

change of free volume of PLLA [47], and then specific

heat remains constant for the samples with given

crystallinity after Tg. Thermal diffusivities of PLLA

samples with different crystallinity were measured

by laser flash method, which is a non-contact tran-

sient thermal measurement method widely used for

measuring the thermal diffusivity (a). With all these

parameters, the thermal conductivity of the samples

can be derived through Eq. (2):

k ¼ a q Cp ð2Þ where q is the bulk density and Cp is the specific heat

at a given pressure.

The thermal diffusivity and the thermal conduc-

tivity of PLLA samples with different crystallinity are

10546 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows that the thermal

diffusivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity reduces moderately due to the decrease in

the phonon mean free path when the temperature

rises, but drops abruptly within the glass transition

temperature range. Taking 120-40 as an example, the

thermal diffusivity decreases by 0.033 mm2/s from

- 70 to 60 C, but decreases by 0.017 mm2/s sharply

only from 60 to 80 C. The sudden drop can be

explained in terms of molecular mobility [48]. But it

should be noted that the abrupt drop trend around Tg

becomes gentler with increasing crystallinity of PLLA

samples. It can be understood from the fact that the

crystallized fractions refine the amorphous phase of

PLLA to a certain degree and hinder the molecular

motion in amorphous regions which will reduce the

phonon mean free path, especially at temperatures

near the glass transition.

Figure 3b shows the relationship between thermal

conductivity of PLLA samples with different crys-

tallinity and temperature. It can be found that the

environmental temperature affects the thermal con-

ductivity obviously. Notably, the glass transition

temperature exerts a great influence on the thermal

conductivity. In the glass state below Tg, thermal

conductivities of all the PLLA samples with different

crystallinity increase with temperature. In this tem-

perature range, two mechanisms with opposite

effects operate [48]. The thermal diffusivity decreases

with temperature increasing, while the increase in

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10547 specific heat attributes more to the thermal conduc-

tivity. The net effect is a smooth and moderate

increase in thermal conductivity with temperature

increasing. When the temperature is further

increased, the amorphous phase of PLLA sample gets

into rubbery state, and the molecular chains of the

amorphous phase begin to move, leading to a great

reduction in the phonon mean free path. So, the

thermal conductivity decreases remarkably. Such a

process produces the maximum of the thermal con-

ductivity near the glass transition temperature in the

range of the measured temperatures. Meanwhile, it

also can be seen that the thermal conductivity of

PLLA samples increases with the increase in crys-

tallinity of PLLA.

To further analyze the effect of the crystallinity on

the thermally conductive properties of PLLA, the

thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA samples at different temperatures

are presented as a function of crystallinity in Fig. 4. The specific heat changes linearly with the increase in

crystallinity of PLLA at different temperatures. The

slope of the fitting curve decreases from 0.118 to

- 0.46 with increasing temperature. It shows that the

specific heat of PLLA decreases with increasing

crystallinity when the temperature is higher than Tg,

due to that Cp for amorphous phase is larger than

crystal phase [49]. However, specific heat of PLLA

samples increases slowly with the increasing crys-

tallinity at temperatures below Tg. Thermal diffusiv-

ity of PLLA increases linearly with increasing

crystallinity, and the increasing rate keeps stable at

the temperatures below Tg, while the increasing rate

increases after Tg. When the amorphous phase is in

the rubber state, the motion of the molecular chains

reduces the phonon mean free path obviously, while

with the increasing crystallinity, the mean free path

increases distinctly. That is why the thermal diffu-

sivity increases obviously with increasing crys-

tallinity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of PLLA

samples as a result of the specific heat and thermal

diffusivity increases with increasing crystallinity.

at given temperatures.

10548 J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 Though the specific heat decreases with increasing

crystallinity after Tg, the thermal diffusivity com-

pensates more for the thermal conductivity. The

increase in thermal conductivity of PLLA samples

with increasing crystallinity is in agreement with that

of other semi-crystallized polymers. However, it

should be noted that TC of PLLA is not significantly

increased with crystallinity. TC of PLLA with the

crystallinity of 56% (120-40) is 0.196 W/mK at 20 C,
only 0.025 W/mK larger than the thermal conduc-

tivity of amorphous PLLA (120-0).

Effect of molecular orientation
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA

To obtain PLLA with different degrees of orientation

and to exclude the influence of crystallization,

amorphous PLLA rectangle samples (120-0 min)

were stretched to different strains uniaxially at 60 C
with the stretching rate of 20 mm/min. Different

positions were marked on the original bars. It is

found in Fig. S2(a) that the strain of every marked

length is consistent, which provides us proof for our

assumption that the orientation of different positions

on the tensile bar is similar. Taking 60-20-4 as an

example, 2D WAXD patterns of different positions on

the tensile bar are shown in Fig. S2(b) to verify the

degree of orientation. It shows that WAXD diffrac-

tions of the three different positions are almost the

same on the meridian and the isotropic scattering

halo develops into the two arcs along the meridian.

From the azimuth scan curve, it can be seen that the

curves of the ‘‘upper, middle, down’’ parts are basi-

cally also the same. These results indicate that

degrees of orientation of different positions along

drawing direction of the tensile bar are the same, and

the differences are negligible. This facilitates subse-

quent preparation of specimens for tests of in-plane

thermal diffusivity.

The middle part of PLLA bars stretched to different

strains is chosen to measure the degrees of orienta-

tion by 2D WAXD. The 2D WAXD patterns are

shown in Fig. 5. The un-stretched PLLA shows reg-

ular concentric rings, indicating that the initial PLLA

bar is amorphous and isotropic. With the increase in

tensile strain, the isotropic halo gradually concen-

trates to the meridian, which indicates that amor-

phous chains of PLLA samples get orientated

gradually along the drawing direction, and the

strength increases gradually. In this process, no

obvious crystal diffraction occurs. The meridian

intensity profiles extracted from the WAXD patterns

in Fig. 5b also show a very broad scattering peak of

amorphous phase without any traces of crystalline

phases. These results clearly demonstrated that the

stretched PLLA bars with different strains are all

amorphous and a series of PLLA with different

degrees of orientation have been achieved to further

reveal the influence of orientation on the thermal

conductivity of PLLA.

Both the in-plane and through-plane thermal dif-

fusivity of the stretched and un-stretched PLLA

samples were measured at 25 C. The thermal

intensity profiles (b) extracted from the WAXD patterns.

J Mater Sci (2018) 53:10543–10553 10549 conductivities are calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the

specific heat and the density are constant, which are

the values of the aforementioned PLLA 120-0 min

(specific heat: 1.195 J/g K, density: 1.243 g/cm3). The

results are shown in Fig. 6. The relation between

thermal diffusivity in the in-plane direction and

tensile strain is opposite to the relation between

thermal diffusivity in the through-plane direction

and tensile strain. The thermal diffusivity in the in-

plane direction increases as the tensile strain increa-

ses, while the thermal diffusivity of PLLA samples in

the through-plane direction decreases with the

increase in tensile strain. This is owing to that the

thermal energy transports more efficiently parallel to

the tensile direction, i.e., along the polymer chain,

which consists of the strong covalent bonds, than

perpendicular to the polymer chain, where the ther-

mal energy is carried by the means of weak van der

Waals interaction of molecules [22]. That is to say, the

phonon mean free path along the tensile direction (in-

plane direction) is larger than that perpendicular to

the tensile direction (through-plane direction).

Therefore, with the increase in orientation, the ther-

mal diffusivity in the in-plane direction increases,

while the one in the through-plane direction decrea-

ses. As the specific heat and density are constant, the

variation of thermal conductivity (k) with the degree

of orientation is consistent with the variation of the

thermal diffusivity with the degree of orientation.

The thermal conductivity in the in-plane direction

(k//) increases linearly with the increase in tensile

strain, and thermal conductivity in the through-plane

direction (k\) decreases linearly with the increase in

tensile strain. When the tensile strain is 4, the TC in

the in-plane direction of PLLA is 0.348 W/mK, while

the TC in the through-plane direction decreases to

0.125 W/mK. The relative thermal conductivities (k/

k0)-strain data are also given in Fig. 7, showing that

the relative in-plane thermal conductivity (k///k0) is

low, only around 2 when tensile strain reaches to 4. Such a linear relationship between k (k// and k\) and

strain and low relative in-plane thermal conductivity

have also been observed previously for other amor-

phous polymers such as PS, PMMA, PC, etc. [30, 32].

conductivity of the oriented material and unoriented

material has been given as Eq. (3).

 

þ ð2=k?Þ ð3Þ TC in the directions parallel and perpendicular to

tensile direction would be principal conductivities

which would indeed bear the relationship of Eq. (3) to a neutral plane conductivity in uniaxially oriented

polymer. However, there is no fundamental reason

why this neutral plane conductivity is the same as the

conductivity of an unoriented specimen [32]. The

corresponding parameters in Eq. 3 of PLLA are listed

in Table 3. It is found that the thermal conductivities

of the oriented and unoriented PLLA conform with

the relationship of Eq. 3. Conclusion

In this work, different crystallinity and degree of

orientation of PLLA were fabricated by isothermal

crystallization at 120 C for different minutes and

stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 C at the

same speed to different strains, respectively. We have

demonstrated the effect of temperature, crystallinity

and degree of orientation on the thermal conductivity

of bulk PLLA samples. The thermal conductivity of

PLLA with different crystallinity was affected obvi-

ously by temperature. Before Tg, the thermal con-

ductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

increases with temperature, mainly resulting from

the increasing specific heat. As the temperature is

further increased to be higher than Tg, the thermal

conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity

decreases remarkably due to the obvious drop of

thermal diffusivity. It demonstrates that thermal

conductivity of PLLA increases with the increase in

crystallinity, but the increasing rate is quite limited.

With orientation, the conductivity was increased in

the direction of molecular orientation and decreased

in the perpendicular direction. The reciprocal of the

two thermal conductivities in different directions of

PLLA stretched to different strains fit a linear

relationship.

Available online 16 October 2012 Abstract

The effects of boron nitride (BN) content and particle size on the thermal properties of BN/high density polyethylene (HDPE)

composites were investigated. The thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of the composites were dependent on the BN content.

For composites with same amount of BN, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with an increase in the size of the

BN particles. Composites with a mixture of different-sized BN particles exhibited higher thermal conductivities than those of composites

with single-sized BN particles. The specific heat capacities of the composites were also affected by the BN content and particle size.

Several theoretical models were employed to predict the effective thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted values were

compared with those obtained experimentally.

1. Introduction

For electronic packaging applications, materials with high
thermal conductivities are required to dissipate the heat
generated by the electronic component effectively. Polymers
are often used in these applications, in addition to being
employed as substrate materials, because of their low dielectric
properties and ease of processing. However, the thermal
conductivities of polymers are usually very low. Therefore,
there is a need to investigate ceramics-filled polymer compo-
sites that have high thermal conductivities [1–4].

Generally, the thermal conductivity of ceramic-filled
polymer composites increases with increasing ceramic
content and particle size. Particles with a high aspect ratio
such as flake- or fibre-shaped particles exhibit the bridging
phenomenon to a larger degree. This assists in the forma-
tion of a conductive path because the percolation threshold
for such particles is lower than that of spherical particles.
However, high-aspect-ratio particles have low packing
densities due to their increased porosity [3]. Usage of a
mixture of different-sized ceramic particles would increase
the thermal conductivity of composites [5–8], as the
e front matter & 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd and Techna G

packing densities of such composites would be higher than
those of composites with single-sized ceramic particles.
Flakes of BN were used as the filler in this study due to

their high conductivity, excellent temperature resistance,
light-weight nature, and moderate cost [1]. High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) was used as the polymer matrix since
HDPE is an engineering thermo-plastic used in several
industrial applications due to its low cost, desirable
mechanical properties, and ease of processing.
Therefore, the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE com-

posites was investigated on the basis of the volume fraction
(Vf) and size of the BN flakes. In addition, several
theoretical models were employed to predict the effective
thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted
values were compared with those obtained experimentally.

2. Experimental procedures

Powders (99.5%, Changsung Corp., Korea) comprising
BN flakes of different sizes were chosen as the fillers for the
polymer matrix composites. The sizes of the BN flakes in
the ceramic powders used in this study were 3 mm, 10 mm,
and 20 mm. HDPE (99.9%, Yuhwa Korea Petrochemical
Ind. Co., Korea) was used as a matrix for the composites.
The BN powders and HDPE were weighed as per the
roup S.r.l.

200 1C at a speed of 30 rpm for 20 min. The mixture was
hot-pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa for 30 min at
200 1C and cooled to room temperature.

The apparent densities of the composites were measured
by the Archimedes’ method. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (D/Max-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Japan) was used to
determine the content and the size of the particles in the
BN powders. The microstructures of the composites were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-
6500F, Jeol, Japan). The specific heat capacities (Cp) and
the thermal diffusivities were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model DSC 200F3, Netzsch,
Germany) and by a laser flash apparatus (LFA) (Model
LFA447, Netzsch, Germany), respectively. The thermal
conductivities of the composites were obtained using their
densities, specific heat capacities, and thermal diffusivities.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Physical properties of composites

The X-ray diffraction patterns for the BN/HDPE
composites with various volume fractions (Vf) and
BN-particle sizes are shown in Fig. 1. The semi-
crystalline phase of HDPE and the single crystalline phase
of BN (JCPDS no. 37-109) could be detected. With an
increase in the BN content, the intensity of the peak for
HDPE decreased. For a given BN content, the intensity of
the peak for HDPE increased with a decrease in the size of
the BN particles.

The peaks for the composites with a mixture of 3 mm-
and 20 mm-sized BN particles exhibited intensities that
were between the intensities of the peaks for the compo-
sites with BN particles with sizes of 3 mm and 20 mm,

respectively. The XRD patterns did not show peaks for
any reaction compounds of BN and HDPE, suggesting
that no chemical reaction took place between the BN
particles and HDPE.
Fig. 2 shows the apparent and theoretical densities of the

composites with various volume fractions (Vf). The appar-
ent and theoretical densities of the composites increased
with an increase in the BN content as the density of the BN
particles is higher than that of HDPE. For composites with
same amount of BN particles, the apparent density did not
change markedly with BN-particle size. With increasing
BN content, the difference between the apparent and
theoretical densities of the composites increased because
of the pores induced at the interface between polymer and
ceramics [3].
SEM micrographs of the composites with various

volume fractions and BN-particle sizes are shown in
Fig. 3. With increasing BN content (Fig. 3(a–c)), the
distance between the BN particles decreased. That is to
say that connectivity among the BN particles as well as the
interfacial area between BN and HDPE increased. The
composites with a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN
particles showed larger conductive networks than did the
composites with single-sized BN particles (Fig. 3(d) and
(e)). The composites with various volume fractions and
BN-particle sizes had the BN particles uniformly dispersed
within the HDPE matrix, with melted HDPE completely
covering the BN particles, resulting in the low porosity of
the composites.

3.2. Thermal properties of composite

The thermal diffusivities and specific heat capacities of
the composites with various volume fractions and BN-
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. With increasing BN
content, the thermal diffusivity of the composites
increased, while the specific heat capacity decreased. These

Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573 S571results are due to the fact that the thermal diffusivity of BN
is higher than that of HDPE, and its specific heat capacity is
lower than that of HDPE. The thermal diffusivity of the

composites increased with an increase in the size of the BN
particles due to the decrease in the interfacial thermal
barrier between BN and HDPE. However, the specific heat
capacity of the composites did not change markedly with
the size of the BN particles. A similar tendency has been
confirmed in BN/polybenzoxazine composites [9].
Fig. 4 shows the experimentally determined and theore-

tically calculated thermal conductivities of the composites
with various volume fractions and BN-particle sizes. The
experimentally determined thermal conductivity of the
composites increased with increasing BN content due to
the thermal conductivity of BN being higher than that of
HDPE. For a given ceramic content, the thermal con-
ductivity of the composites increased with increasing BN-
particle size because the heat conducting paths were
thicker and the junctions had lower thermal resistance in
the composites with the larger particles of BN than in the
composites with smaller BN particles.
For electronic packaging applications, the ability to

predict the thermal conductivity of the composites effec-
tively should be considered when designing ceramic/poly-
mer composites with high thermal conductivity. Several
theoretical models were employed to predict the thermal
conductivity of the composites with various volume frac-
tions and BN-particle sizes. The Bruggeman and Russell

Y.K. Shin et al. / Ceramics International 39 (2013) S569–S573S572models [6] were not used to fit the experimental data due to
the fact that the fillers used in this study were not spherical
or cubic in shape. However, the Nielsen–Lewis model
[6,10] was in good agreement with the experimental values
well up to Vf of 0.4, above which the model failed because
of the presence of pores, as shown in Fig. 4. This result is due to the fact that, unlike the other
models, the Nielsen–Lewis model includes a fitting para-
meter A (morphology factor) to describe the shape of the
filler. The Nielsen–Lewis model is based on the following
equation:

where leff, lp, and lc are the thermal conductivities of the
composites, polymer, and ceramic, respectively; Vf is
the volume faction of the ceramic; constant A is related
to the morphology of the composites (irregular-shaped
particles have a larger value of A than do spherical
particles (A¼1.5)); fm is maximum packing fraction. For
composites with same amount of BN particles, the values
of A and fm increased with increasing BN-particle sizes
(Fig. 4).

Fig. 5 shows the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE
composites with the volume fraction of BN equal to Vf of
0.3 and a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles.
For the composites with the Vf of 0.3 and a mixture of
3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles, the thermal conduc-
tivity increased when Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles was
0.09. It then decreased with a further increase in the
volume fraction of the 3 mm-sized BN particles. These
results can be explained by the fact that the 3 mm-sized BN
particles fill the space between the 20 mm-sized BN parti-
cles until Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles reaches 0.09(Fig. 3(f)). This leads to an increase in the number of
conductive paths.

4. Conclusions

With increasing BN content, the thermal conductivities
and the thermal diffusivities of BN/HDPE composites
increased, while the specific heat capacities decreased.
For a given BN content, the thermal conductivity and
the thermal diffusivity of the composites increased with an
increase in the sizes of the BN particles. However, the
specific heat capacity of the composites did not change
markedly with the BN-particle size. The thermal conduc-
tivity of composites containing a mixture of different-sized
BN particles was higher than that of composites contain-
ing only single-sized BN particles (3 mm or 20 mm). The
experimentally determined values of thermal conductivity
were in good agreement with those obtained using the
Nielsen–Lewis model.

Influence of the Molecular Architecture of Low-Density
Polyethylene on the Texture and Mechanical Properties
of Blown Films

Received 7 February 2002; revised 30 April 2002; accepted 31 October 2002 ABSTRACT: Three types of low-density polyethylene materials were investigated with
respect to the influence of the molecular architecture on the mechanical and use
properties of blown films. The materials were a branched polyethylene synthesized by
free-radical polymerization under high-pressure (HP-LDPE), a linear ethylene–hexene
copolymer (ZN-LLDPE) produced by low-pressure Ziegler–Natta catalysis, and an
ethylene–hexene copolymer (M-LLDPE) from metallocene catalysis. The extrusion and
blowing conditions were identical for the three materials, with a take-up ratio of 12 and
a blow-up ratio of 2.5. The blown films displayed a decreasing puncture resistance in
the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and HP-LDPE. In parallel, the tear resistance of the
films became increasingly unbalanced in the same order of the polymers. The morpho-
logical study showed an increased anisotropy of the films in the same polymer order, the
crystalline lamellae being increasingly oriented normal to the take-up direction. This
texturing caused a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the films, notably
increasing the capacity for crack propagation. The phenomenon was ascribed to the
kinetics of chain relaxation in the melt that governed the ability of the chains to recover
an isotropic state from the flow-induced stretching before crystallization. The puncture
resistance was examined in terms of both texture and strain-hardening capabilities.

INTRODUCTION

Since the early 1970s, ethylene/-olefin copoly-
mers synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysis have
been largely developed in the domain of blown
films for packaging applications, in concurrence
with low-density polyethylenes (PEs) produced by
high-pressure free-radical polymerization. In re-

cent years, copolymers issued from metallocene
technology have taken an increasing place in the
field of film blowing because of excellent optical
properties combined with remarkable mechanical
performances.1 For the processing difficulties of
metallocene copolymers due to narrow molar
weight distributions (MWDs), technical solutions
have been found by either the incorporation of
very low amounts of long side chains or the pro-
duction of bimodal MWDs.2,3 There is, however,
much work left to do to understand the property
upgrade of such novel materials, notably for film
applications.

The influence of molecular orientation on the
use properties of PE blown films has stimulated
profuse studies on the processing–structure and
processing–property relationships.4–31 Neverthe-
less, little has been accomplished in terms of un-
derstanding the influence of the molecular archi-
tecture on the structure and mechanical proper-
ties of films, via processing conditions. This study
focused on three types of low-density PE issued
from three different types of polymerization tech-
niques. The differences in the use properties of
the blown films were analyzed through the crys-
talline texture under similar processing condi-
tions for the various polymers.

EXPERIMENTAL

Three low-density PE materials from various
sources were studied. The molecular and physical
characteristics of the materials are shown in Ta-
ble 1. M-LLDPE and ZN-LLDPE were linear eth-
ylene–hexene copolymers synthesized by metal-
locene and Ziegler–Natta catalysts, respectively.
The former one, with a narrower MWD, was sus-
pected to contain a few long side chains on the
basis of elongational viscosity. HP-LDPE was is-
sued from the high-pressure free-radical polymer-
ization of ethylene in an autoclave. It contained
long-chain branches (LCBs) and short-chain
branches (SCBs) mainly composed of butyl side
groups with minor amounts of ethyl side
groups.32 Tubular blown films, about 50 m thick, were
processed with an annular die extruder with a
15-cm diameter and a 1.5-mm gap. For the sake of
comparison of the blown-film properties, the pro-
cessing conditions were kept as close as possible
for the three materials: flow rate  40 kg/h, melt
temperature at the die  190 °C, frost-line height
 50 cm, take-up speed  12 m/min, take-up ratio
(TUR) 12 in the so-called machine direction
(MD), and blow-up ratio (BUR)  2.5 in the trans-

verse direction (TD). These conditions corre-
sponded to the optimum blowing capabilities of
HP-LDPE. The direction perpendicular to the film
surface was defined as the normal direction (ND).

For the evaluation of the intrinsic properties of
the materials, 1-mm-thick isotropic sheets were
also prepared. Pellets were compression-molded
for 5 min at 180 °C and subsequently crystallized
by being cooled to room temperature (RT) at
about 20 °C/min.

The relaxation time, , of the materials in the
melt was determined from viscoelastic measure-
ments at 190 °C with a Rheometric RSA II appa-
ratus in the cone–plane configuration. The assess-
ment of  was made from the Cole–Cole diagram
of the loss shear modulus versus the storage
shear modulus.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) mea-
surements were performed on a PerkinElmer
DSC-7 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The calibration of the temperature scale was
achieved from the melting scans of high-purity
indium and zinc samples at the same heating
rate. The melting point (Tf) of the materials was
determined at the peak of the melting endotherm
of the heating scan following standard cooling
from the melt at 10 °C/min.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used
to investigate the crystalline lamellar morphology
and texture of the films. The X-ray beam was
provided by a Rigaku Cu rotating anode having a
0.1 mm focus and operated at 30 kV and 40 mA.
An assembly of two Ni-coated curved mirrors at a
right angle was used for a punctual collimation of
the incident beam. The scattered intensity was
detected with a position-sensitive linear counter
selecting Cu K X-ray photons. It was located at
80 cm of the sample, with a vacuum section be-
tween the detector and sample. For optimum X-
ray absorption, approximately 2-mm-thick sam-
ples were made by several pieces of films or com-
pression-molded sheets being piled up. For blown
films, the through-view scattering curves were

recorded parallel to both MD and TD. Edge-view
scattering curves were also recorded parallel to
MD and ND. For a comparison of the scattering
intensity profiles versus the scattering vector of
the various materials, all the intensity data in
arbitrary units were corrected for the background
scattering, absorption, and Lorentz factor.33 The
transmission coefficient for every sample was de-
termined from the ratio of the peak intensities of
the incident beam with and without the sample.
The intercrystalline long period, L, was directly
determined from the correlation peak of the in-
tensity profile. The average crystal thickness, Lc,
was assessed from the equation Lc  Lc, which
assumes much greater length and width of the
crystalline lamellae than their thickness. The
crystal volume fraction, c, was computed from
the density, , of the material with the relation c

 (  a)/(c  a), where c  1.000 g/cm3 and a

 0.855 g/cm are the densities of perfectly crys-
talline orthorhombic PE and amorphous PE, re-
spectively.34 Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experi-
ments were performed in the transmission mode
with monochromatic Cu K radiation. Through-
view patterns on films were recorded on a two-
dimensional CCD camera.

The tear and puncture resistance of the blown
films were determined at RT according to the
standard Elmendorf test (ASTM D 1922) and dart
impact test (ASTM D 1709), respectively. Conven-
tional tensile stress–strain measurements were
carried out at RT on an Instron testing machine
at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min, with dumb-
bell samples 100 mm in gauge length. Both iso-
tropic sheets and films were tested. For films,
tensile experiments were carried out along MD
and TD. The reported curves are representative of
three different measurements.

Shrinkage measurements of the blown films
above Tf were carried out with 5 cm  5 cm
specimens suspended by small clamps into an
oven at 130 °C for 5 min. Shrinkage data along
MD and TD were assessed from the ratio of the
dimension change to the initial dimension of the
film piece. Experiments at various temperatures
between 125 and 135 °C showed some tempera-
ture dependence of the M-LLDPE shrinkage,
whereas ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE proved to be
almost insensitive. However, the ranking of the
materials in terms of shrinkage capacity did not
depend on temperature.

TEAR AND PUNCTURE RESISTANCE OF
THE FILMS

An examination of the dart impact data of films in
Table 2 shows that HP-LDPE has the lowest
puncture resistance of the three materials. More-
over, the perforation of HP-LDPE films appears
as an elongated crack parallel to TD. In contrast,
ZN-LLDPE exhibits an elongated perforation par-
allel to MD. M-LLDPE displays the best film
puncture resistance, and the perforation is fairly
circular. These observations are relevant to the
structural anisotropy of both HP-LDPE and ZN-
LLDPE, whereas M-LLDPE looks rather iso-
tropic.

Under tear testing, HP-LDPE displays the low-
est capabilities of the three materials. It is nota-
bly unbalanced, with a higher tear resistance in
MD. The better tear performances of M-LLDPE
are fairly well equilibrated along MD and TD.
M-LLDPE is challenged by ZN-LLDPE with re-
spect to the level of tear resistance, even though
the latter displays nonequilibrated properties,
the higher tear resistance being in TD.

In summary, the puncture and tear properties
of M-LLDPE are fairly high and isotropic despite
the largely unbalanced TUR and BUR of the
films. In contrast, HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE re-
veal strong anisotropy along TD and MD that
suggests chain orientation and/or crystalline tex-
turing of the films. The anisotropy effect is, how-
ever, opposite in the two materials, despite iden-
tical blowing conditions: ZN-LLDPE is more tear-
resistant in TD than in MD, whereas HP-LDPE
displays greater tear resistance in MD. Similar
observations of opposite behavior between linear
PE films11,15,23,24,30 and branched PE films20,28 can be found in the literature for usual blowing
conditions notably involving TUR  BUR. This
surprising finding suggests that the intuitive pic-
ture of an improved tear resistance normal to the

in most cases, does work for ZN-LLDPE but does
not work for HP-LDPE. Otherwise, it was pro-
posed by Kim and coworkers23,24 and Andre et
al.29 that crystalline lamellar orientation might
be more important than the molecular orientation
with respect to tear resistance because lamellae
are likely to act as obstacles to crack propagation.
This is the reason for the following structural
study.

STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE

Compression-Molded Sheets

For the three kinds of PE studied, the SAXS data
of Table 3 reveal very similar if not equal crystal
thicknesses for isotropic sheets and films. This is
relevant to the relatively low sensitivity of low-
density PE materials to the cooling rate, that is,
about 20°/s for blown films and 20°/min for com-
pression-molded sheets.

Considering the densities of the materials under
investigation and using the data from Kuhn and
Krömer,32 we can assume a butyl SCB rate of about
17/1000 C (where C is a carbon atom of the polymer
backbone) for HP-LDPE, whereas a rough figure of
18/1000 C can be assumed for the butyl SCB con-
centration of both ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE ac-
cording to various literature data.23,35,36 Under
such considerations, it turns out that the average
distance between short branches along the main
chain is about 7 nm. The quite good consistency of
this figure with the crystal thickness of the materi-
als reported in Table 3 supports the largely ac-
cepted scheme of an exclusion from the crystalline
phase of the SCB having two carbon atoms or more.
As a matter of fact, if the SCB bulkiness prevents
the counit inclusion in the crystal lattice due to
crystal growth, one should expect Lc to be governed

by the average length of the crystallizable methyl-
ene sequences.37 M-LLDPE and HP-LDPE have somewhat
lower Lc values (Table 3) than ZN-LLDPE, with
a concomitant lower Tf. This is relevant to the
more uniform distribution of the counits or
SCBs of the former two materials. Heteroge-
neous ZN copolymers are indeed well known to
grow thicker crystals with higher Tf values than
homogeneous copolymers or branched PEs of
similar crystallinity38 – 40 because of almost
counit-free chains. This is an advantage for
some applications such as hot tack but is prej-
udicial for optical properties, for instance.38 This structural difference should nonetheless
have very little impact on tear and puncture
properties, notably on anisotropy.

Blown Films

Figure 1 shows the through-view SAXS profiles
from the films of the three materials recorded
parallel to MD and TD. The nearly identical in-
tensity profiles of Figure 1(c) indicate a fairly
isotropic structure for M-LLDPE in the plane of
the film, which contrasts with the strong anisot-
ropy of the HP-LDPE film revealed in Figure 1(a).
Not only is the SAXS correlation peak much
higher along MD than along TD for HP-LDPE,
but the peak intensities are respectively greater
and smaller than those of the M-LLDPE SAXS
peak. This anisotropy of HP-LDPE is relevant to
the well-known flow-induced row texture of blown
films and spun fibers41 with the crystalline lamel-
lae essentially normal to MD. The ZN-LLDPE
film displays an intermediate state of orientation
[Fig. 1(b)] between HP-LDPE and M-LLDPE
films [Fig. 1(a,c)], the crystalline lamellae being
still preferentially normal to MD.

SAXS measurements from the edges of the
films corroborate the row texture of the HP-LDPE

film, as judged from Figure 2. As a matter of fact,
the edge-view profile recorded along MD shows a
much stronger intensity maximum than the one

along ND. This is clear evidence that most of the
crystalline lamellae lie normal to MD. It is quite
surprising that M-LLDPE also displays some an-
isotropy from the edge view of the film [Fig. 2(b)],
which suggests that the elongated crystalline la-
mellae, otherwise lamellar ribbons, have a pre-
dominant orientation along ND. Considering the
through-view isotropy of M-LLDPE [Fig. 1(c)], we
may ascribe this finding to a preferred orientation
of the growth direction of the lamellar ribbons,
namely, the crystallographic b axis,42 along the
temperature gradient43,44 during the crystalliza-
tion step, that is, the film thickness in this in-
stance. This effect should also exist for HP-LDPE
but is certainly hidden by the flow-induced row
texture. The M-LLDPE film may, therefore, be
called orthotropic rather than isotropic.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 331 The WAXS patterns of Figure 3 show a rein-
forcement of the inner (110) and outer (200) re-
flections in the MD and TD positions, respec-
tively, for HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films. This is
relevant to the so-called low-stress row structure
of Keller and Machin,41 which corresponds to a
preferred orientation of the twisted crystalline
lamellae with the crystallographic b axis, that is,
the growth axis, roughly parallel to TD, and the a
and c axes being randomly distributed about TD
because of the lamellar twisting. The diagonal
reinforcement of the (110) reflection for the HP-
LDPE film [Fig. 3(a)] reveals a sharper orienta-
tion of the b axis parallel to TD than for ZN-
LLDPE. The M-LLDPE film displays no preferred
orientation of the crystalline phase in the film,
indicating isotropy or orthotropy. These WAXS
data corroborate the conclusions from SAXS.

With respect to the compression-molded
sheets, the unreported WAXS patterns confirm
the completely isotropic structure for the three
materials.

UNIAXIAL TENSILE DRAWING

Compression-Molded Sheets

In conjunction with structural investigations,
several authors have used uniaxial tensile draw-
ing of blown films to understand the tear and
puncture behavior.10,20,24,30,31 Because the dart
test is equivalent to a multiaxial tensile test, it is
obvious that uniaxial testing at various orienta-
tions with respect to MD may be valuable for
understanding the puncture resistance of films.
In contrast, tensile drawing does not seem to have
significant relevance to tear resistance, at first
sight. Nevertheless, it clearly appears from the
literature data24,30 that the more unbalanced the
tear resistance is in MD and TD of blown films,
the greater the departure is of both the strain
hardening and the elongation at break of the films
upon tensile drawing along MD and TD.

The engineering stress–strain curves of the iso-
tropic compression-molded polymers are reported
in Figure 4. The three materials have about the
same yield stress at 10  1 MPa. However, HP-
LDPE displays a lower elongation at rupture and
a lower strain hardening than ZN-LLDPE. This
well-known phenomenon can be ascribed to the
bulkiness of the branched molecules with LCBs,
which limit chain overlapping in the melt. A re-

films: (a) HP-LDPE, (b) ZN-LLDPE, and (c) M-LLDPE

332 GUICHON ET AL.

sult of this phenomenon is to reduce the entan-
glement density and the intercrystalline tie chain
frequency in the crystallized material.38 This
point is more specifically addressed in the Discus-
sion section.

M-LLDPE displays a lower elongation at break
than ZN-LLDPE but exhibits a surprisingly
higher strain hardening. A similar observation in
a previous study40 has been ascribed to a higher
concentration of entanglements and tie chains in
M-LLDPE because of the homogeneous distribu-
tions of the counits, which not only reduces crys-
tal thickness in comparison with ZN-LLDPE (see
the previous section) but also reduces the pro-
cesses of regular folding and reeling-induced dis-
entanglement of the chains during crystalliza-
tion. Therefore, in contrast to HP-LDPE, which is
less resistant to tensile drawing than ZN-LLDPE
because of lower overlapping of the chains, M-
LLDPE looks significantly more resistant than
ZN-LLDPE because of better chain intertwining.

Blown Films

Figure 5 shows the tensile stress–strain curves
along MD and TD for the three types of films.
M-LLDPE displays quite similar behavior when
tested along MD and TD [Fig. 5(c)]. Besides, the
stress–strain curves resemble that of the isotropic
compression-molded sheet (Fig. 4), notably with
respect to extension at break and strain harden-
ing. This finding means that M-LLDPE is almost
isotropic and accounts for the well-equilibrated

TD and MD tear resistance. In contrast, HP-
LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films exhibit unbalanced
tensile properties along MD and TD [Fig. 5(a,b)],

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 333 notably a lower drawability along MD. Besides,
drawability in both directions is lower than that
of the compression-molded sheets, this phenome-
non being much more pronounced for HP-LDPE.
This means that both ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display a higher degree of chain extension in MD.
In parallel to its much reduced drawability in
MD, HP-LDPE displays a surprising jump of the
yield stress to about 15 MPa in MD, in contrast to
10 MPa in TD and for the isotropic sheet. This point
is specifically addressed in the Discussion section.

The nearly isotropic properties of the M-
LLDPE film suggest that the chains have an al-
most undisturbed coil conformation despite the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. In contrast,
the unbalanced properties of ZN-LLDPE and HP-
LDPE films, together with the significant loss of
drawability with respect to their isotropic com-
pression-molded counterparts, are relevant to a
significant chain extension in the films. This is
evidence that the flow-induced extension of the
chains during the blowing process has been partly
frozen-in during the solidification step, for both
HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE. This suggests that
these two materials have less capacity for chain
relaxation in the melt than M-LLDPE, HP-LDPE
being the most quenching-sensitive.

The strain hardening of M-LLDPE, both in
films and sheets, is somewhat higher than that of
the two other materials. Such a property notably
reduces the capacity for plastic instabilities dur-
ing deformation and, therefore, contributes to the
improvement of the puncture resistance of the
M-LLDPE film. As a corollary to its higher strain
hardening, the M-LLDPE film exhibits lower
standard deviations of the tear and puncture re-
sistance data (Table 2) that are relevant to a
weaker sensitivity to structural film defects such
as thickness fluctuations and inclusions.

DISCUSSION

Table 4 reports a summary of the film properties.
Both structural and mechanical anisotropy in-
crease in the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and
HP-LDPE. In comparison with the compression-
molded sheets, the tensile drawing of the films
clearly reveals that, despite the similar blowing
conditions, the three materials have different lev-
els of chain extension (otherwise chain unfolding)
depending on the chain architecture. The shrink-
age data of Table 4, which reflect the degree of
chain extension frozen in the films, thoroughly
support this conclusion. The material rankings
for the degree of chain extension of the films are
the same as the previous ones for the increasing
anisotropy. The different levels of chain extension
of the three materials, superimposed on the crys-
talline texturing, can be analyzed with regard to
the rheological properties of the materials, in re-
lation to the processing conditions.

Chain Relaxation during Blowing

The mean relaxation time data of Table 1 show
that the three materials have quite different ca-
pabilities of relaxation in the melt of the flow-
induced chain extension accompanying TUR  12and BUR  2.5. Considering the frost-line height
of about 50 cm and the take-up speed of 12 m/min
used in the blowing process, one may estimate
that the molten material experiences an exten-
sional flow for about 2.5 s before solidification.
The actual duration of the extensional flow is
certainly shorter than this figure because the
chain-extension pathway along TD and MD is not
uniform over the whole length between the die
and the frost line. Therefore, it is clear that the
relaxation time of HP-LDPE may hardly allow a

recovery of the flow-induced chain extension dur-
ing the time that elapses between extrusion and
crystallization. In contrast, ZN-LLDPE and M-
LLDPE are clearly capable of relaxing the flow-
induced chain extension, at least in part, before
crystallization.

Ghaneh-Fard et al.45 pointed out the role of
chain relaxation on the orientational behavior of
blown films in the melt before crystallization. Yu
and Wilkes22 emphasized the drastic effect of long
chains having a long relaxation time on film ori-
entation. Lu et al.30,31 demonstrated that the
shape of the incipient bubble, which is governed
by the cooling conditions, strongly influences the
film texture and properties because of the modi-
fications of the relaxation capabilities of the mol-
ten material along MD and TD. Prasad et al.46 also reported recently that LCBs in linear HDPE
induce a strong texturing of blown films because
of a drastic increase of the longest relaxation time
in the melt. In contrast, Plumbey et al.20 reported
a nearly isotropic structure for metallocene copol-
ymer films, despite unbalanced TUR and BUR
values. Recently, Legros et al.26 reported that
metallocene copolymers afford significantly less
oriented films than corresponding Ziegler–Natta
copolymers. These observations, which corrobo-
rate our own findings on the M-LLDPE film, can
unambiguously be ascribed to the rather short
relaxation time of metallocene copolymers, which
is due to the narrow MWD.

With respect to the shrinkage behavior, the
data reported in the last column of Table 4 show
that the three kinds of films systematically shrink
more along MD than along TD. However, these
data also display quite different shrinkage capa-
bilities of the films in the order HP-LDPE  ZN-
LLDPE  M-LLDPE. The very low shrinkage of
the M-LLDPE film is notably indicative of a very
faint chain extension. This finding thoroughly
agrees with the MD and TD tensile drawing be-
havior of the M-LLDPE film, which closely resem-
bles that of the compression-molded sheet. There-
fore, the so-called orthotropy of the M-LLDPE
film, which has been concluded from the stand-
point of texture, turns out to be very close to
isotropy from a mechanical standpoint.

ZN-LLDPE is slightly unbalanced with respect
to the stress–strain curves in TD and MD [Fig.
5(b)], and the curves are not so far from the one of
the isotropic sheet (Fig. 4). In contrast, HP-LDPE
is highly unbalanced, and the stress–strain
curves reveal higher drawability along TD. Be-

sides, HP-LDPE displays significantly lower
strain hardening and lower stress at break than
ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE. The strong mechani-
cal anisotropy and poor performances at rupture
provide an explanation for the relatively poor dart
impact resistance of the HP-LDPE film.

The contrasting behaviors of HP-LDPE and
ZN-LLDPE with respect to tearing, that is, the
higher tear resistance being along MD and TD,
respectively, suggest a competition between crys-
tal orientation and chain extension in the process
of crack propagation, which is discussed later.

The quite different degrees of texturing of the
three kinds of materials, which greatly influence
their tensile drawing behavior and use properties,
can be explained by the rheology of the materials:
the much shorter relaxation time of M-LLDPE in
the melt allows an almost complete relaxation of
the flow-extended chains toward the stable ran-
dom coil conformation, during the time elapsing
between the die and the frost line. ZN-LLDPE
and HP-LDPE are only partly able to relax the
chain extension before crystallization, the latter
having greater hindrance for chain relaxation.

Chain Intertwining

The entanglement of chains has a tremendous
effect on both rheological and solid state prop-
erties. It strongly contributes to the strain-
hardening effect in the elongational viscosity,
which is a basic factor of bubble stability during
tubular film blowing.47 It is also a determining
factor for the mechanical properties of blown
films via drawability and strain hardening.
However, it is noteworthy that branched and
linear PEs display a puzzling opposite behavior
with respect to this latter property: namely, the
strain hardening of melt elongational viscosity
is high for branched PEs and low for linear
PEs,47 whereas just the opposite trend is ob-
served for the solid materials.38 This phenomenon emphasizes the drastic in-
fluence of molecular dynamics on chain extension
in the melt, which contrasts with the predomi-
nance of structural factors such as the entangle-
ment density on chain extension in the solid state.
Indeed, in the case of elongational flow experi-
ments,47 the strain hardening of branched PEs,
which is relevant to chain extension, can be re-
duced to about nothing if the timescale of the
experiments is comparable or greater than the
relaxation time. This is a clear indication of the

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 335 transient character of the chain network in the
melt, which may disentangle under extensional
flow at a low strain rate. For linear PEs, no strain
hardening of the elongational viscosity suggests a
high capacity for chain disentanglement during
extensional flow. In the solid state, chain exten-
sion is governed by the entanglement density,
which determines the strain hardening.48 The
lower strain hardening of branched PEs may be
ascribed to a low entanglement density.

The ability of polymer chains for intertwining
in the melt is mainly connected to the chain flex-
ibility, which is explained by the so-called C

parameter. Besides this parameter, the overlap-
ping capability of the chain coils of a given poly-
mer species, such as PE in this instance, is highly
sensitive to the molecular architecture of the
chains. If we neglect thermal expansion effects,
the degree of chain overlap in the melt can be
defined as the ratio

X  /app (1) of the actual density of molten PE,   0.85 g/cm3,to the apparent density of the chain coils, app.
Indeed, if we consider an isolated chain of molar
weight M, the X parameter provides an estima-
tion of the number of parent chains of the same
molar weight that must intertwine within the
volume embraced by the isolated chain in a ran-
dom coil conformation to achieve the actual den-
sity of the molten polymer. The apparent density
of the isolated chain can be estimated from the
ratio of the molar weight to the volume of the
sphere of radius equal to the radius of gyration of
the random coil, Rg, because this sphere enfolds
more than 90% of the segments of the chain coil.49 For linear PE and ethylene copolymers, one may
consider the following relationship established
from literature data:50 Rg  1.26M1⁄2 (2) where Rg is given in nanometers and M is given in
kilodaltons. Now, if we consider a linear low-den-
sity polyethylene (LLDPE) chain with M  100kDa, that is, about the weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) for the polymers investigated in this
work, it turns out that Rg is approximately 12.6nm, and the apparent density is app  0.02 g/cm3.Borrowing from Kuhn and Kromer’s32 study of
the molecular architecture of HP-LDPE, we have

sketched Figure 6 a chain of molar weight M
 100 kDa of the single-autoclave HP-LDPE in a
branch-extended conformation. The HP-LDPE
molecule notably exhibits 10 LCBs with an aver-
age molar weight between LCBs close to 6 kDa.
One may estimate to about 42 kDa the molar
weight of its main chain, which is shown as a bold
line in Figure 6. Assuming, in the first approxi-
mation, that LCBs do not significantly change the
chain conformation in the melt, one may estimate
the radius of gyration of the HP-LDPE chain coil,
Rg  8.0 nm, from the length of its main chain
with eq 2. The apparent density of the HP-LDPE
chain coil is, therefore, app  0.08 g/cm3. Despite numerous assumptions, the aforemen-
tioned apparent density data reveal that the
chains are deeply interpenetrated in the molten
materials: for a chain of molar weight M  100kDa, the degree of chain overlap is X  50 for
LLDPE and X  12 for HP-LDPE. Besides, these
data show that chain overlap is much greater for
LLDPE than for HP-LDPE.

This finding suggests that interchain entangle-
ments, which provide the strength of the molecu-
lar network in the melt and in the solid state, are
significantly more numerous in linear chains
than in branched chains. Indeed, reduced over-
lapping reduces the probability of neighboring
chains intertwining with each other. This has
already been claimed to be an explanation for the

Figure 6. Schematic drawing for the molecular archi-
tecture of an HP-LDPE branched chain with a molar
weight of 100 kDa.

336 GUICHON ET AL.

higher strain hardening of linear PEs in the solid
state.38 Of course, LCBs can make entanglements
among themselves, within the sphere of gyration
of the coil, but these intramolecular entangle-
ments only contribute to the coil stiffness instead
of the network strength. However, as previously
pointed out, the strain hardening in the melt is
lower for linear PEs than for branched PEs. This
phenomenon, apparently contradicting the higher
entanglement density of linear PEs, can be ex-
plained by dynamic effects during the extensional
flow in the melt,47,51 namely, a lower resistance to
either disentanglement or strain-induced orienta-
tion of linear chains in comparison with branched
chains. The longer relaxation time in the melt of
branched PEs (see Table 1) supports this proposal
of reduced chain dynamics due to LCBs.

Chain Unfolding versus Chain and/or Lamellar
Orientation

Several authors have recently suggested that the
orientation of lamellar stacks in blown films is
responsible for unbalanced properties,24,29–31 in
contrast with most authors, who incriminate mo-
lecular orientation. Lu et al.30,31 notably showed
that processing conditions that promote randomly
oriented lamellar stacks reduce mechanical an-
isotropy and improve dart impact resistance. Our
data on M-LLDPE thoroughly support this find-
ing. However, because ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display the same type of texture, with the lamel-
lae preferentially oriented normal to MD, the re-
verse trend of the two types of films with respect
to MD and TD tear resistance reveal that the real
situation is somewhat more complex than that
previously described. We suggest that, beyond la-
mellar and chain orientations, chain unfolding is
a factor of prime importance.

It is quite obvious that the unfolding of the
chains during the blowing process increases the
density of chain segments lying in the plane of the
film. If one intuitively considers that tear resis-
tance is governed by the frequency of such chain
segments that oppose themselves to the propaga-
tion of the crack, one should expect an improve-
ment of tear resistance with increasing chain ex-
tension. The drawability and shrinkage data from
Table 1 clearly show that the ZN-LLDPE film has
preferred chain extension along MD, and this
means that more chain segments will bar the way
to the crack propagation along TD in comparison

with MD. This is why ZN-LLDPE has greater tear
resistance in TD than in MD.

Regarding the HP-LDPE film, both drawability
and shrinkage show that there is a high degree of
chain extension along MD and moderate chain
extension along TD, the latter being significantly
higher than that for ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE.
An explanation for this is that the branches of the
star-shaped macromolecules are unfolded in the
two main directions during the blowing process,
and only a part of this unfolding can be relaxed
before crystallization because of the rather high
relaxation time. The chain extension that is fro-
zen in the film is greater along MD because of the
higher value of TUR with respect to BUR. In
addition, because the chains are not ideally
spherical but consist of a main chain with lateral
LCBs, as sketched in Figure 6, this main chain is
likely to preferentially unfold along MD during
the blowing process because TUR  BUR and also
because of a suspected much longer relaxation
time of the main chain in comparison with that of
the LCBs. Consequently, the LCBs should act as
molecular arms, slightly extended in TD, all along
the main chain. If this is the case, a propagating
crack would cross more chain segments in MD
than in TD. This provides an explanation for the
greater tear resistance of HP-LDPE in MD than
in TD, that is, a reverse behavior of that of ZN-
LLDPE. Nevertheless, the overall higher level of
tear resistance of the latter can be explained by
the higher degree of chain overlapping of ZN-
LLDPE, which involves a higher degree of chain
entanglement and, therefore, a higher mechani-
cal strength of the macromolecular network.

The fact that the M-LLDPE film is challenged
by the ZN-LLDPE film with respect to the level of
the tear resistance in both MD and TD, despite its
well-equilibrated tear behavior and better punc-
ture resistance, deserves special attention. The
explanation is straightforward in consideration of
our previous argument on the density of chain
segments that can act as obstacles to the propa-
gation of the crack during the tear test. Indeed,
the nearly isotropic M-LLDPE film necessarily
contains fewer chain segments oriented parallel
to the film plane than the ZN-LLDPE film to
make opposition to either MD or TD tear. It is,
therefore, suggested that isotropy is beneficial for
puncture resistance because of the high drawabil-
ity afforded by the chain in a random coil confor-
mation, but this is not favorable for optimum tear
resistance, despite good balance.

MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE 337 Finally, a last comment should be made re-
garding the shape of the stress–strain curve along
MD of the HP-LDPE film, the yield stress being
50% higher than that along TD, as well as that of
the isotropic material. This phenomenon has been
reported previously for branched PEs38 but never
for linear PEs. This cannot be explained solely by
the high degree of chain extension along MD. We
suspect that the strong orientation of the crystal-
line lamellae with their normal along MD, as
judged from SAXS [Fig. 1(a)], prevents the plastic
shear processes through both the sample width
and thickness of the film because the resolved
shear stress (RSS) on the (hk0) slip planes is nil.
Plasticity may only take place after some tilt of
the lamellae to orient the slip planes toward the
maximum RSS. Rotation about the b axis is by far
the most easy tilt process because of the rather
large form factor of the lamellae. However, the
high degree of chain extension along MD, already
discussed, is likely to hinder the lamellar tilting
as the applied tensile stress increases. The criti-
cal RSS in the crystalline lamellae will then be
reached after the applied tensile stress has
jumped much above the value required for yield-
ing for the corresponding isotropic sample.

Isotropy versus Orthotropy

ZN-LLDPE exhibits better tear resistance than
M-LLDPE, despite its anisotropy. In contrast, iso-
tropic M-LLDPE has a better puncture resistance
because of high drawability with high energy ab-
sorption. Therefore, if the chain extension that
takes place during blowing involves an increase
in the chain segment density within the film
plane that is beneficial for tear resistance, it is
quite clear that isotropy is beneficial for puncture
resistance. One may, nevertheless, wonder if or-
thotropy, involving equilibrated chain extension
along MD and TD, would not be the best way for
optimum puncture and tear resistance, with a fair
balance of the latter along MD and TD.

Metallocene PEs have short relaxation times in
the melt that make them able to recover most of
the chain extension developed during the time of
the blowing before crystallization. This is the rea-
son for the fair isotropy of the films, which ac-
counts for the mechanical properties. Linear PEs
can also be blown into nearly isotropic films, but
the reasons are quite different. TUR and BUR are
generally the major factors of film texturing. The
common situation, with TUR greater than BUR,

leads to the row structure with the crystalline
lamellae normal to MD. Reducing the TUR/BUR
ratio provides a means of reducing the structural
anisotropy and improving in parallel both the
puncture resistance and tear resistance bal-
ance.18,25,29–31 Unfortunately, this situation is too
far from industrial conditions of film blowing.
However, the deformation path of the molten ma-
terial during tubular blowing is strongly depen-
dant on the processing parameters, such as the
stress, air velocity, and freeze-line height. Those
parameters may be adjusted for re-equilibrating
the difference of chain extension induced by the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. The deforma-
tion path can notably be modified by changes in
the freeze-line height.28,30,31,52,53 Therefore, the
shape of the bubble in the deformation zone be-
tween the die and the crystallization line may
have the form of either a bowl or a stemmed
glass,52 depending on whether film stretching
along MD and TD takes place in a simultaneous
or sequential manner, respectively. This involves
a modification of the molecular extension pro-
cesses and notably enables a more important re-
laxation-induced rearrangement of the chains in
the direction in which chain extension occurred
first.30,31,53 This was the way used by Lu et al.31 to
reverse the MD-to-TD tear resistance ratio for
HDPE films for the same TUR/BUR ratio of ap-
proximately 8. Despite this high TUR/BUR ratio,
the authors showed that increasing the time al-
lowed for MD chain relaxation involved a higher
level of TD chain extension in comparison with
MD, as revealed by the MD and TD tensile draw-
ing curves.31 This resulted in an unusual greater
tear resistance for linear PE in MD than in TD.

Some authors have claimed that isotropy is
favorable for film use properties.10,18,19 However,
it seems that the so-called isotropy of the films,
judged either from two-dimensional structural
studies in the plane of the film or from the com-
parison of MD and TD mechanical properties,
might be, in fact, an orthotropy. Only metallocene
PEs really display isotropy, regardless of blowing
conditions, because of relaxation times much
shorter than those for conventional linear or
branched LDPE at an equivalent melt-flow index
(MFI).

CONCLUSIONS

The tear and puncture resistance of films largely
depend on the processing-induced texture. M-

338 GUICHON ET AL.

LLDPE has a very short relaxation time in the
melt in comparison with the time that the mate-
rial remains in the molten state between the die
and the frost line. This enables the chains
stretched by the blow-up and take-up to relax to a
nearly isotropic state. This almost annihilates
film texturing and imparts better dart impact
performances in comparison with those of ZN-
LLDPE and HP-LDPE. The slightly higher strain
hardening of M-LLDPE, which is ascribed to a
very small number of LCBs, also contributes to its
high puncture resistance.

The better use properties of ZN-LLDPE in com-
parison with those of HP-LDPE are assigned to
better chain intertwining and higher strain hard-
ening in the solid state. The opposite behavior of
the two materials with respect to the unbalanced
tear resistance of the films is ascribed to the chain
architecture: linear chains mainly unfold along
MD for ZN-LLDPE, whereas chains with LCBs
unfold along both MD and TD for HP-LDPE.

Even though M-LLDPE provides the best com-
promise of maximum puncture resistance and
quite high and well-equilibrated tear resistance,
it is not as good as ZN-LLDPE with respect to the
tear resistance level. This is attributed to the
nearly isotropic structure with an almost random
chain distribution, which reduces the probability
of chain segments lying within the film plane.
These segments are the ones most prone to stop
crack propagation. It is, therefore, suggested that
orthotropy, with some degree of chain extension
within the film plane, would be the better texture
for optimized tear and puncture resistance for
either ZN-LLDPE or M-LLDPE. HP-LDPE will
never reach equivalent use properties because it
lacks strain hardening.

The generalization of our conclusions to all
kinds of PEs produced by similar polymerization
methods cannot be made without precautions.
However, a general conclusion is that the average
relaxation time in the melt is a major factor for
the development of texture and mechanical an-
isotropy. This may help us to understand some of
the specific properties reported in the literature,
notably in consideration of the time allowed to the
various sequences of the blowing process. The
knowledge of a whole distribution of relaxation
times, in combination with a complete molecular
characterization, would be a promising way to
progress into the structure–property relation-
ships of PE films.

Available online 12 July 2005 Abstract

Three nearly identical linear low density polyethylene resins based on copolymers of ethylene with 1-butene (B), 1-hexene (H) and

1-octene (O) were utilized to investigate the effect of short chain branch length on the mechanical properties of blown and compression

molded (quenched and slow cooled) films. The content of short chain comononer in the three copolymers was ca. 2.5–2.9 mol% that

corresponded to a density of 0.917–0.918 g/cm3. Within a given series, the tensile properties of these films do not show any significant

difference at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min), even though the DSC and TREF profiles of ‘H’ and ‘O’ differed slightly in

comparison to ‘B’. However, at higher deformation rates (ca. 1 m/s), the breaking strength of these films was found to increase with

increasing short chain branch length. In addition, the Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength of the blown films were also observed to

increase with increasing short chain branch length. Further, dart impact strength and high-speed puncture resistance (5.1 m/s) of 1-octene and

1-hexene based samples was also observed to be higher than that based on 1-butene. The blown films displayed low and comparable levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and crystalline orientation by wide angle X-ray scattering. This confirms that the differences in mechanical

properties in the blown film series are not attributable to differences in molecular orientation. The deformation behavior of both the

compression molded and blown films were also investigated in a well-defined controlled regime by analyzing their essential work of fracture.

It was found that the essential work of fracture of films based on 1-hexene and 1-octene was higher than that of films based on 1-butene. While

the origin of these differences in mechanical properties with increasing short chain branch length is not fully understood, the present

investigation confirms this effect to be pronounced at high deformation rates for both the blown and compression molded quenched films.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378820films. As will be reviewed below, many studies have

attempted to address this same topic but in doing so, many

important and influential parameterswere not necessarily well

controlled in the respective investigations. We believe the

present report has improved on this aspect aswill be discussed.

LLDPE resins are typically produced using Ziegler Natta

heterogeneous catalysts, whose origins can be traced back to

the late 1950s [1]. However, the resins produced by these

catalysts are characterized by considerable heterogeneity in

their microstructure and melting behavior and are con-

sidered to be a mixture of fractions of polyethylene

copolymers with a range of molecular weights and short

chain branch content. In the mid 1990s, with the commercial

advent of high efficiency single site metallocene catalysts,

narrow molecular weight distribution LLDPEs with con-

siderably more homogenous distribution of short chain

branches were produced. Metallocene-based LLDPE resins

have now been commercialized using various different

catalyst technologies [2–6]. The single site metallocene

catalysts produce copolymers that have much narrower

molecular weight distributions (ca. 2–3) and a greater

uniformity in the distribution of the short chain branching

across the width of the molecular weight distribution

relative to the Ziegler Natta catalyzed systems.

LLDPE resins of all types constitute a major segment of

the polyethylene (PE) blown film market worldwide. It is

known that the mechanical properties of the LLDPE films

are influenced by molecular structural parameters such as

molecular weight, molecular weight distribution in addition

to the amount as well as the short chain branch distribution

(SCBD) across the width of the copolymer molecular

weight distribution. Morphological features such as degree

of crystallinity, intercrystalline connectivity and preferred

orientation are also strongly believed to have an effect of the

mechanical properties of blown LLDPE films [7–19].

Short chain branching critically affects the crystallinity

and thus the morphology and consequently the solid-state

properties of the corresponding LLDPE films. As a result, a

broad range of properties of LLDPEs can be obtained by

varying the amount of SCB and the SCBD. In addition, the

length of the short chain branch may also play an important

role in governing the mechanical properties—the specific

issue that will be addressed in this study. Early on, Cady

[20] investigated the effects of the type of short chain

branching (SCB) and SCBD on the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strength of blown films of LLDPEs based

on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene that were synthesized

using Zeigler Natta catalyst chemistry. For similar density

and melt flow index, the 1-butene based resins performed

poorly in comparison to those based on 1-hexene and

1-octene, even though it had a more homogenous SCBD.

However, comparison of two different 1-octene based resins

that differed in their SCBD indicated better mechanical

performance for the 1-octene based resin that had a more

homogenous SCBD. No comment was made on the relative

amounts of the short chain branching in each of the resins, %

crystallinity or orientation of the blown films. However, it

was concluded that the combination of the short chain

branch length and a more homogenous SCBD leads to better

mechanical properties of LLDPE blown films. In a similar

study utilizing LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene that had densities in the range of 0.919– 0.921 g/cm3, melt flow indices of 0.9–1 dg/min and

polydispersities of 3.3–4.1, Liu and Baker [21] observed

the impact strength to increase with increasing short chain

branch length. It was suggested that the longer short chain

branches lead to a larger fraction of tie molecules in the

interlamellar region that causes the observed increase in

impact strength. However, in this study as well, both the

comonomer content and the SCBD varied simultaneously,

thereby making the interpretation of the corresponding

effects uncertain. In a third study, Kim and Park [22] observed

a similar trend for Zeigler-Natta catalyzed 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene based LLDPE blown films that had relatively

larger polydispersities (w6), varying comonomer compo-

sition (4.3, 3.7 and 2.8 mol% of 1-butene, 1-hexene and

1-octene, respectively) and varying branch density (21, 17 and

13 CH3/1000 C for 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene based

resins, respectively). The differences in the dart impact and

Elmendorf tear strengths of the blown films based on the three

resins were attributed to the differences in short chain

branching distributions and increased imperfections in the

crystallographic order and decreased lamellar thickness

with increasing short chain branch length.

Wolfe [23] studied the effect of comonomer type on the

slow crack growth resistance of high-density polyethylene

using the PENT (ASTM F1473) test. Of the two

comonomers investigated (‘B’ and ‘H’), the HDPE based

on 1-hexene failed after 400 h compared to 30 h in the case

of HDPE based on 1-butene. No comment, however, was

made on the molecular weight, distribution of the short

chain branches and orientation of molecular chains in the

pipe resins utilized.

By investigating LLDPE resins based on 1-butene and

1-octene, Kale et al. [24] compared the intrinsic tear

strengths for two sets of resins (each set had two resins

based each on 1-butene and 1-octene) of densities 0.912 and

0.921 g/cm3, respectively. The resins had similar poly-

dispersities (2.12–2.25), melt flow indices (0.93–1.02) but

different short chain branch comonomer content. For the

0.912 g/cm3 set of resins, the mol% of 1-butene was 4.17 and that of 1-octene was 3.04; for the 0.921 g/cm3 set of

resins, these were 3.04 and 1.77 mol%, respectively, for

1-butene and 1-octene. Despite the differences in their

comonomer content and the lack of information on the

SCBD, the higher intrinsic tear strength of the 1-octene

based LLDPE resins relative to the 1-butene based resins

was speculated to be due to enhanced tie molecule

formation with increasing short chain branch length.

Further, the observed difference in the melting point versus

mole fraction comonomer relationships for 1-butene and

1-octene based LLDPE resins was suggested to be due to the












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8821incorporation of small amounts of 1-butene into the

crystalline phase and/or variations in the commoner

sequence distributions. However, Alizadeh et al. [25] and

Alamo et al. [26] have shown that the melting point

depression with increasing mole fraction of the short chain

branch comonomer is independent of the type of the

comonomer, i.e. at any given mole fraction of 1-butene,

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene in metallocene catalyzed

copolymers with polyethylene, the melting point depression

of all these copolymers was observed to be comparable.

Further, Alizadeh et al. [25] observed that at any given

mol% of the short chain branch comonomer, the degree of

crystallinity was also very comparable for LLDPE based on

1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. These obser-

vations clearly suggest that the degree/probability of branch

exclusion from the lamellar crystal is independent of the

comonomer type, viz. 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Therefore, in turn, one would expect no differences in tie

molecule formation for the three LLDPE materials based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.

Kennedy et al. [27] also studied the tensile stress–strain

behavior of metallocene catalyzed LLDPE resins based on

1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-methyl-1-pentene. It

was observed that the nominal-stress strain curves, that were

measured at low deformation rate of 0.0004 m/s (1 in./min)

compared to high deformation rates involved during the

impact (0.2–4 m/s) and Elmendorf tear testing (0.1–7 m/s),

were dominated by strain hardening for all the LLDPEs

resins excepting those based on 1-butene. The yield stress

and initial modulus were related to the degree of crystal-

linity regardless of the short chain branch comonomer.

More importantly, for the highest molecular weights studied

(MwO100,000 g/mol) the force-elongation curves

(recorded at low deformation rates of 0.0004 m/s) for the

four resins were observed to be similar to one another for the

same short chain branch content. This last observation is

important for until the present report, the tensile stress strain

behavior of LLDPE resins, particularly based on 1-butene,

1-hexene or 1-octene, have not been systematically studied

at high deformation rates similar to those involved in dart or

Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength testing. In

addition, the dart or Spencer impact strength and Elmendorf

tear resistance measurements, although standard ASTM

measurements in industry are characterized by non-uniform

deformation rates.

It is important to note that most of the studies that relate

to the influence exerted by the branch length involve

comparisons of LLDPE films from resins that either have

different short chain branch contents, different comonomer

distribution profile (SCBD), different polydispersities or

different short chain branch density on the main ethylene

backbone. As a result, it is extremely difficult to properly

interpret the results and separate the effects of the individual

parameters (mentioned above) on the physical properties of

LLDPE resins due to their simultaneous variation. Thus, in

this study, three LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene

and 1-octene, that have been carefully synthesized [28] using the same single site metallocene based catalyst, were

examined to specifically investigate the effect of the

comonomer type (short chain branch length), viz.

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene on the mechanical proper-

ties of blown and compression molded LLDPE films. As

will be discussed later, these three resins were very

comparable in terms of their molecular, rheological,

comonomer content and SCBD aspects. As a result, any

differences arising out of structural differences from other

origins, while not fully eliminated, were minimized. Results

from the earlier study [28] showed that while the tensile

properties, at nominal deformation rates, of the blown films

were indistinguishable, the Elmendorf tear, dart impact and

Spencer impact properties of the 1-butene based films were

significantly lower than the corresponding 1-hexene and

1-octene based films. The difference between 1-hexene and

1-octene films was much smaller with a slight advantage for

the 1-octene films. In this study, we attempt to further

investigate the effect of the type of the short chain branch on

the mechanical properties of LLDPE films since other

parameters (like comonomer content, SCBD, molecular

weight, molecular weight distribution, polydispersity and

density) were established to be essentially constant [28].

The mechanical properties were measured utilizing Spencer

impact, Elmendorf tear resistance and high-speed puncture

resistance measurements as well as in a controlled tensile

deformation regime by utilizing the essential work of

fracture methodology/technique.

2. Essential work of fracture (EWF)

Recent studies have indicated that the EWF procedure is

a very useful method to study the fracture properties of thin

films and ductile materials [29–33]. The concept of EWF

was developed initially by Cotterell and Reddel [34] on the

basis of ideas proposed by Broberg [35], who suggested that

the total work of fracture (Wf) dissipated in a precracked

specimen could be represented as a sum of the work

consumed into two distinct zones. As shown in Fig. 1, the

double-edge-notched-tension (DENT) specimen that is

precracked along the horizontal (inwards from the vertical

edges) to leave a ligament region ‘l’ that undergoes the actual

deformation in tension under a load ‘F’ along the vertical.

The regions marked as ‘1’ and ‘2’ depict the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and the outer plastic zone, respectively, (OPZ).

The work dissipated in the FPZ corresponds to the

essential work of fracture (We); and the work required to

yield the material in the OPZ is the non-essential work of

fracture (Wp) that depends on the geometry of the specimen

tested. Thus, the total fracture energy is expressed as (more

details are provided elsewhere [34]):

Wf ZWe CWp ZweltCwpbl

Fig. 1. Sample geometry utilized in the double edge notched tension

(DENT) mode. The zones marked with 1 and 2 indicate the fracture process

zone (FPZ) and outer plastic zone (OPZ), respectively. The ligament length

(denoted as ‘l’) in the present study was 1, 2 or 3 mm.

ligament area), wp is the specific non-essential work of

fracture (per unit volume), l is the ligament length, t is the

specimen thickness and b is the plastic zone shape factor.

The total specific work of fracture is represented by:

wf Z
Wf

lt
Zwe Cbwpl (2) From Eq. (2), it is clear that wf has a linear relationship with

the ligament length. In other words, a plot of the wf as a

function of l should be linear with the intercept on the

ordinate axis and the slope providing we and bwp,

respectively. Thus, this method involves testing of speci-

mens that have different ligament lengths, and then

evaluating the Wf for each specimen (area under the

force–displacement curve) followed by suitable normal-

ization with respect to the ligament area to give a plot of wf

vs. l. The best-fit regression line would then give the slope

(bwp) and intercept (we).

When plane stress conditions prevail for all ligament

lengths, it is assumed [36] that we is a material property (a

constant) at a given thickness. Mathematically, for plane

stress conditions, the following two relationships should be

satisfied:

(4)

Under these conditions, it has been demonstrated theoreti-

cally [37] and supported experimentally [37–39] that we is

equivalent to Jc, or the J-integral. For a nonlinear elastic

body containing a precrack and undergoing deformation, Jc
represents the strain energy release rate of nonlinear elastic

materials and is given by: [40] JC ZK
dU

dA
(5)

where U is the potential energy (also the difference between

the strain energy stored in the body and the work done by

external forces of deformation) and A is the crack area. It

can be seen that the units of Jc are also energy/area (the

same as we). Thus, the advantage of the EWF method is its

experimental simplicity as compared to the J-integral

procedure.

3. Experimental

3.1. Material synthesis

The three LLDPE copolymers (based on ethylene-co-1- butene, ‘B’, ethylene-co-1-hexene, ‘H’, and ethylene-co-1- octene, ‘O’) used in this study were synthesized by using a

Chevron Phillips’ proprietary zirconium based metallocene

catalyst [28]. The copolymerization was conducted in a pilot

plant at Chevron Phillips under steady state slurry-loop

copolymerization conditions. The comonomers and the

catalyst were fed continuously and the polymer fluff was

continuously removed from the reactor. The fluff was

purged with nitrogen to remove residual solvent and

unreacted olefins followed by blending with antioxidants

and a processing aid. The polymers were then extruded into

pellets.

3.2. Characterization of the resins

The molecular, rheological and branching characteristics

of the three resins are listed in Table 1. The rheological data

were obtained using a Rheometrics Scientific Inc., ARES

rheometer. Small strain (10%) oscillatory measurements

across a frequency range of 0.03–95 rad/s were made at

190 8C under a nitrogen blanket. The resulting complex

viscosity versus frequency data was fitted using the modi-

fied Carreau–Yasuda (CY) empirical model [41,42] to

obtain the zero shear viscosity (h0). The molecular weight,










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8823and the molecular weight distribution were determined by

gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Nuclear magnetic

resonance (NMR) was utilized to determine the amount of

comonomer and thus the short chain branching incorporated

into the respective copolymers. The experimental proce-

dures of these two techniques are outlined in detail else-

where [43]. In addition, the comonomer composition

distribution across the molecular weight distribution of

these three copolymers was determined by a recently deve-

loped chemometric technique [44] based on size exclusion

chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectros-

copy (SEC–FTIR).

Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) was

performed on the three resins to determine the homogeneity

of incorporation of SCB in the copolymers. This was done

by using a triple detector TREF instrument which was

assembled using parts retro-fitted into a Waters 150C GPC

system. The column (12.55 mm ID and 150 mm in length)

was packed with #30 stainless steel shot (Vulcan Blast Shot

Technology, Brantfor, Ont., Canada). The oven heater pro-

vided programmed cooling and heating in the 35–150 8C range. It was controlled externally via West 4400 set point

programmer. Three detectors, viz. a Foxboro infrared (IR)

(3.4 nm), a Viscotek 150R viscometer and a PDI 15 and

90-degree dual-angle light scattering detector, were utilized

for characterization. The viscometer and the light scattering

detector were housed in the same oven while the IR cell was

heated separately. Sample solutions were prepared in the

carrier solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), at 3 mg/mL.

In the experiment, 500 mL of the sample solution was

injected onto the column at 150 8C and subsequently cooled

to 35 8C at a rate of 0.72 8C/min, to allow slow and complete

crystallization. The column was then slowly re-heated to

150 8C at a rate of 1.5 8C/min with a solvent flow rate

of 0.5 mL/min, during which the polymer molecules

re-dissolved and eluted out into the three detectors. Analysis

of the data obtained from the IR detector was done to get

normalized weight fraction of the fractionated copolymer as

a function of the temperature.

3.3. Film preparation

Blown films were made from each of the three resins

under the following conditions: 100 mm (4 in.) die diameter,

1.5 mm die gap, 37.5 mm diameter single-screw extruder

(L/DZ24, compression ratio 2.2:1), 115 rpm screw speed (ca.

27 kg/h output rate), 2.5:1 blow up ratio (BUR) and barrel and

die temperatures set to 190 8C. The freeze line height (FLH)

was between 20 and 28 cm and cooling was accomplished

with a dual lip air ring using ambient air that had a temperature

of ca. 20 8C. Films with different thicknesses (12.5–100 mm
or 0.5–4 mil) were produced this way. These conditions are

representative of typical commercial scale LLDPE blown

film processing according to scaling procedures established

previously [45].

In addition to these blown films, unoriented quenched

and slow cooled compression molded films were also pro-

duced. Preweighed amounts of the copolymer pellets were

melted in a mold at 150 8C for 10 min followed by the

application of 3000 lb f (ca. 1350 kg f) for 5 min. Quenched

(Q) samples were prepared by being removed from the

heater plates followed by being placed on a wooden labora-

tory bench and exposed to ambient conditions. The samples

took ca. 5 min to cool to ambient temperature (ca. 20 8C).

For the slow cooled (SC) samples, the mold containing the

molten film was allowed to remain between the heater plates

after the pressure was released. The power to the heater

plates was then turned off to allow slow cooling of the films.

The samples attained room temperature in ca. 8 h. Both the

Q and SC films were ca. 125 mm (5 mil) in thickness.

3.4. Film characterization

The blown films of different thicknesses were tested for

their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and

Elmendorf tear resistance according to ASTM D-1709 (method A), ASTM D-3420 (although a special in-house

pendulum was utilized to ensure failures) and ASTM

D-1922 standards, respectively, at ambient conditions. In

addition, high-speed puncture resistance of the LLDPE

copolymers, at a high impact velocity (5.1 m/s), was also

investigated. For this test, quenched compression molded

and slow cooled plaques of approximately 3.35 mm

thickness were employed. The compression molded speci-

mens (corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) were clamped in a

circular fixture that is 76 mm in diameter. A 23.76 kg mass

tup/dart (13 mm diameter hemispherical end) was dropped

on the clamped specimens at an impact velocity of 5.1 m/s

(corresponding to a drop height of 1 m). The direction of

impact was parallel to the specimen thickness, and the point

of impact was at the center of the clamped specimen. The

tup/dart was equipped with a load sensor to measure the load

response as a function of time, during the impact event. A

separate photo sensor provided a measurement of the initial

impact velocity. At a given weight of the tup/dart assembly

and its impact velocity, the specimen load-deflection data

for the impact event was recorded. Total energy (J) to

rupture as measured from the load-deflection curve was

used to characterize the impact performance. The quantities

(energy to rupture) measured from this test are not fixed

material properties as they depend on the test specimen size

(thickness) and the specific test conditions.

Blown films that were 25 mm in thickness (each from

resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) in

addition to the compression molded films were chosen for

the rest of the characterization methods utilized including

refractive index measurements, differential scanning calori-

metry (DSC) and essential work of fracture analysis. Flat

plate wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of the

blown films were obtained at ambient conditions using a

Philips PW1720 X-ray generator. Four layers of each of

the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown film (based on 1-butene,












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–883788241-hexene and 1-octene) were carefully aligned and stacked

on the sample holder to obtain sufficient scattering intensity

for exposure of the WAXS pattern at 40 kV, 20 mA and 4 h.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 5 cm. The X-ray

beam was parallel to the normal of the sample plane.

Pin-hole collimated small-angle X-ray scattering

(SAXS) profiles of compression molded films were

collected at ambient temperature using a Rigaku Ultrax18 rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and

60 mA. A pyrolytic graphite monochromator was used to

filter out all radiation except the Cu Ka doublet, with an

average wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The camera used 200, 100 and 300 nm pinholes for X-ray collimation. Two-dimen-

sional data sets were collected using a molecular metrology

2D multi-wire area detector, located ca. 65 cm from the

sample. After azimuthal averaging, the raw data was

corrected for detector noise, absorption, and background

noise. The data were then placed on an absolute scale using

a type 2 glassy carbon sample 1.07 mm thickness,

previously calibrated at the advanced photon source at the

Argonne National Laboratory, as a secondary standard. All

the SAXS profiles presented have been masked in the low

scattering vector region where the beam stop influenced the

profiles.

Refractive index measurements were conducted at

ambient conditions on all the compression molded films

and the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films using a Metricon

Prism coupler Model 2010 along the three coordinates.

Measurements in the normal (ND), machine (MD) and

transverse direction (TD) were recorded. An average of 3–5 measurements was reported in each direction. Thermal

behavior was investigated on a Seiko SSC/5200 DSC. The

heating and cooling traces were recorded at 20 8C/min in a

nitrogen-purged atmosphere to study the melting and

crystallization of these samples. Small angle light scattering

(SALS) patterns in the Hn configuration were recorded at

ambient conditions by utilizing a He–Ne laser at 633 nm.

The sample to imaging plate distance was 11 cm.

Crystalline, amorphous and interfacial contents in

compression molded films were estimated by analyzing

the free induction decay (FID) data obtained from NMR

(method described below), although Alamo et al. [26] and

Mandelkern et al. [46,47] have utilized a different method

involving analysis of Raman spectra on LLDPEs based on

1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In the present study, all

NMR measurements on compression molded films were

made using an Auburn IMR analyzer operating at 20 MHz.

Morphological analysis was accomplished by fitting the free

induction decay (FID) to a three-component model, viz.

crystalline, amorphous and interfacial. The data was

obtained using a 908 pulse (2 ms), 1 s pulse delay (which

was much greater than five times T1) and a 17 ms dead time

to eliminate signal contamination from the probe ring down.

Each FID consisted of 300 points, where each data point

was sampled every 1 ms, with 160 transients acquired to

improve signal-to-noise. The model utilized to fit the data

was based on the procedure suggested by Kristiansen [48].

where a is related to the hydrogen–hydrogen distance and b

is related to the width of Gaussian broadening. Since, a and

b are associated with the crystalline domain, and more

specifically a function of the hydrogen–hydrogen distance,

these two parameters are expected to be constant. Therefore,

a series of ten resins with densities from 0.918 to 0.960 were

analyzed. The values found for a and b did not vary much

and average values obtained were: aZ1.070eC05, bZ
72,940. These were used in all the fits reported in this study.

The two functions C[x] and S[x] are also referred as Fresnell

functions.

The best fit of the signal intensity–time relationship for

the hydrogen nuclei located in the non-crystalline domains,

viz. interfacial and amorphous, can be expressed as the

where two separate sets of values of the pre-exponential

factor, A, spin–spin relaxation time, T2, and the Weilbullian

factor, d, were utilized for amorphous and interfacial

domains, respectively. The three equations were then solved

simultaneously by putting the FID data into an Excel

spreadsheet and using Microsoft Solver to find the best least

squared fit between the experimental data and the model.

Tensile stress–strain curves were recorded at 1 m/s on a

specialized MTS system 810. The servohydraulic actuator

was operated in displacement control. The force transducer

(Kistler 9712B50) was mounted directly to the crosshead.

The force signal was amplified with a Kistler 5010B and

acquired with a Nicolet Integra oscilloscope at data

acquisition rates of 10–40 kHz, depending on specimen

type. The specimen geometry utilized for tensile tests was

rectangular, 75!17 mm2. The distance between the jaws of

the tensile tester was 10 mm. For the DENT mode,

specimens of 25.4!25.4 mm2 (1!1 in.2) with ligament

lengths of 1, 2 and 3 mmwere tested at 1 m/s. It is noted that

for blown films, the specimens deformed in the MD

direction are representative of the measurement in the TD

as the crack propagates in the TD. Likewise, the samples

deformed in the TD are representative of the measurements

in the MD. Thus, the EWF results for blown films are

reported corresponding to the direction of the propagation of

the crack. For a thorough regressional analysis, at least five

specimens were tested at each ligament length. Prior to












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8825testing, the specimens were weighed to compute the average

thickness of the film in the ligament region. Individual

force–displacement curves were integrated by a computer

program to calculate the total fracture energy. This was then

normalized by the area of the ligament to provide the

specific fracture energy (wf) and then plotted against the

ligament length (l). Regression analysis of this data was

performed to obtain the values of the intercept which equals

the essential work of fracture, we.

4. Results and discussion

As can be seen in Table 1, the three copolymers (‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’) are essentially identical in their basic molecular

and rheological characteristics. These three resins have a

very similar melt flow index (1.01–1.09 g/10 min) and

density (0.917–0.918 g/cm3). The number average (Mn) and

weight average molecular weight (Mw) obtained from the

GPC are nearly identical (43.2–44.2 and 97.9–99 kg/mol,

respectively). The GPC curves for each of the three resins,

as shown in Fig. 2 are also comparable. This behavior is

further supported by very similar zero shear rate viscosity

values (7.13–7.26 kPa s). The polydispersity (2.22–2.27),

that reflects the breadth of the molecular weight distribution,

and the total comonomer content (2.47–2.95 mol%), as

obtained by NMR, is also very similar for each of these three

resins. The NMR data also indicate the presence of small

levels of ethyl branches in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resin (0.12 and

0.15 mol%, respectively). This is due to the generation of a

small level of ‘in situ’ ethyl branches that are indistinguish-

able from the ethyl branches introduced by 1-butene in the

copolymerization of ‘B’ copolymer. For the ‘H’ and ‘O’

resins, these ethyl branches were detected by NMR in

addition to the butyl and hexyl branches, respectively. Thus,
Fig. 2. Molecular weight distribution and the number of short chain

branches (corresponding to each resin) per 1000 carbon atoms of the

backbone of the three LLDPE resins (indicated on the secondary ordinate

axis).
the total mol% reported in Table 1 reflects the total amount

of short chain branches (including the very small amount of

ethyl branches in addition to the butyl or hexyl branches,

respectively, for the ‘H’ and ‘O’ resins). Nevertheless, the

total comononer content ([X] mol%) required to make a

0.918 g/cm3 density is somewhat higher for the 1-butene

copolymer than those based on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The

short chain branching distribution data is plotted in Fig. 2 (secondary ordinate axis). The number of short chain

branches/1000 C atoms in each of three resins is essentially

uniform (9–11/1000 C) across the width of the molecular

weight distribution. Despite some scatter at the low and

high-end of the molecular weight distribution that is

attributed to higher error in the measurements [44], the

three copolymer resins indicate a similar SCBD. Another

parameter that indicates the uniformity of the distribution of

short chain branches across the MWD is the % relative

monomer dispersity (%RMD) index, as determined by

solution NMR [51,52]. RMD is the tendency of the

comonomer units to be either ‘isolated’ (%RMDZ100) or

‘clustered’ (%RMD!100). The values of the three resins

utilized in this study are essentially the same, viz. 99.1, 99.7 and 99.3% for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively.

The information from the chemometric technique to

determine the SCBD (as reported in Fig. 2) does not indicate

the distribution of the short chain branches along a given

polymer chain. To ascertain any difference in this

distribution for the three copolymers, TREF was performed

on each of the LLDPE resins. These results are provided in

Fig. 3. All three resins (‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) possess the general

comonomer distribution profile characteristic of the resins

produced by single site metallocene catalysts [53,54]. In the

Ziegler–Natta catalyzed LLDPE resins, a low temperature

peak (between 45 and 55 8C) that is due to the elution of a

soluble fraction heavily concentrated with comonomers and








Fig. 3. TREF profiles of the three LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1- hexene and 1-octene.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378826a broad peak in the 55–80 8C range that is due to the elution

of ‘branched’ fraction made up of polymer molecules of

various comonomer contents are also observed [55].

However, the absence of the low temperature peaks (in

the range of 45–80 8C) in the TREF profiles of metallocene

catalyzed LLDPE resins utilized in this study indicate a

homogenous incorporation of the short chain comonomer in

the linear ethylene backbone as compared to resins

synthesized by Ziegler–Natta catalysts. A closer inspection

of the three profiles in Fig. 3 indicates some differences that

are most likely attributable to some level of difference in the

SCB distribution (along a given polymer chain) among the

three copolymers utilized in this study. These differences

show that resin ‘B’ has the most homogeneous crystal-

lizability/solubility behavior in comparison to ‘H’ and ‘O’.

These differences were primarily manifested in the ‘second

heating’ DSC results on blown and compression molded

films (results discussed in detail later, Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)),

where the presence of a low temperature shoulder on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ was

observed. This difference in the second melting DSC

behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise

from the slightly more homogenous distribution of SCB

(along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles. However, the SCBD data in

Fig. 2 and the near 100% RMD values of the three resins

indicate that the overall or average SCB distribution across

the MWD is in fact very similar for all three copolymers.

Hence, we believe that the magnitude of any differences that

may be observed in physical properties (discussed later)

cannot simply be attributed to this difference in the TREF

profiles.

The refractive index data on compression molded and

25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films is listed in Table 2. As can

be observed, within a given series (be it quenched, slow

cooled or blown) the average refractive index for the three

resins is essentially the same. As expected, the average

refractive indices of the slow cooled films are somewhat

higher than the corresponding quenched and blown films.

For the blown films, the refractive index was observed to be

slightly higher in the MD than that in TD, as might also be

expected. The difference in the refractive indices in the MD

and TD directions, respectively, nMDKnTD, gives the in-

plane birefringence, Dn. These are listed as well in the

extreme right in Table 2. The small values of Dn do not

indicate a high level of orientation along the MD (in

comparison to that in TD) in these films. The out-of-plane

birefringence, nMDKnND, is 0.0013, 0.0011 and 0.0015 for

‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, respectively. These values are

comparable to the in-plane birefringence, thereby indicating

a slight uniaxial orientation for these blown films. The

WAXS patterns taken with the beam parallel to the sample

film normal are shown in Fig. 4. The intensities of the

(1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections show some azimuthal

dependence, as expected. In particular, the (200) reflections

are slightly lower in intensity at the equator than that at the

meridian, thereby indicating a low a-axis orientation along

the MD. This is a common observation for polyethylene

blown films produced at low stress levels. As expected, the

(110) plane reflections, on the other hand, have a relatively

lower meridianal intensity than that observed equatorially.

Returning to the refractive index data in Table 2, the

density of the films from the average refractive index was

calculated by the following relationship [56]:

the LLDPE films are listed in Table 2. For the samples in a

given series (be it quenched, slow cooled or blown), the

films (based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’) had essentially the same

density and consequently %Xc within limits of experimental

error. This is in agreement with the results reported by

1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene at a given mol% of the

short chain branch comonomer. Their work did not support

the notion that any of the short chain branches are included

in the crystalline lattice. In the present study, the density and

consequently the %Xc of the blown and quenched films are

lower than the slow cooled samples, as expected.

The lamellar scale lengths in the quenched and slow

cooled compression molded films are indicated by SAXS

results in Fig. 5. As can be seen, within a given series, the

scattering patterns are essentially identical for ‘B’, ‘H’ and

‘O’. It is clear that the differences in TREF profiles in Fig. 3 do not affect the SAXS behavior on the lamellar scale for

both the series investigated (compression molded quenched

and slow cooled). As expected, the long period is larger in

slow cooled films (223 Å) than that in quenched films

(205 Å). In addition, the results from the free induction

decay NMR experiments, that gives information on the














P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378828relative contents of ‘rigid’ (crystalline), ‘intermediate’

(interfacial) and ‘mobile or liquid-like’ (amorphous) phases

indicated that the content of these phases was very similar

for ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ within a given series in the compression

molded samples (Fig. 6). For the compression molded

quenched samples, the weight fractions of crystalline,

interfacial and amorphous domains are ca. 59.5, 29.8 and

11.3%, respectively, in ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ films, while the

respective values for the compression molded slow cooled

are 63.1, 24.5 and 12.7%. The calculated crystalline content

in the slow cooled films is larger than for the quenched

films, as expected. However, the interfacial content in the

slow cooled films is slightly less than that in the quenched

films, although the amorphous content is very similar in

both the compression molded series. In general, the values

of crystallinity obtained from free induction decay NMR

tends to be higher than those obtained from DSC. This is due

to the fact that taut tie molecules can also contribute to the

‘rigid’ phase. Very recently, Yoon et al. [58] utilized SAXS

and solid-state NMR method (rotor-encoded rotational echo

double resonance technique) to investigate the structure of

metallocene catalyzed LLDPEs as a function of comonomer

type (1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) and content. They

also did not observe any structural differences in their series

of ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials investigated that had a ca.

3 mol% comonomer content.

Returning to the present study, larger scale lengths at the

micro level for our materials were characterized by SALS.

The spherulitic scale lengths in the compression molded

quenched and slow cooled films are indicated by the Hn

SALS in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the SALS patterns (within a

given series, be it quenched or slow cooled), are similar for

the ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. These ‘four-lobed’ patterns are

characteristic of a spherulitic morphology. However, when

comparing the patterns of the slow cooled with that of the

quenched films, it appears that the slow cooled films have

larger but less well-defined spherulitic structures than the

quenched films. This was also supported by the surface

analysis of these films by scanning electron microscopy

(SEM) (results not shown here). The SALS patterns in the

Hn configuration can be utilized to calculate the average size

of the spherulites by use of the following relationship

[59–61]:

4pR

 
Z 4:13 (10) where R, is the radius of the spherulites, lm is the

wavelength in the scattering medium and qmax is the angle

of intensity maxima in one of the lobes of the Hn pattern.

The calculated diameter for the quenched films was in the

range of 2.9–3.6 mm (B–Q: 3.3 mm, H–Q: 2.9 mm and O–Q:

3.6 mm) whereas the slow cooled films were in the range of

3.8–4.2 mm (B–SC: 3.8 mm, H–SC: 4.2 mm and O–SC:

4.2 mm). As expected, the size of the spherulites in the slow

cooled films is larger than that in quenched films.

Furthermore, the SEM analysis on these films indicated a

broad distribution of sizes (data not shown).

The first and second DSC heating–cooling profiles of the

blown films are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The

first heating (Fig. 8(a)) is extremely comparable for each of

the three, ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ blown films, with melting

transition peaks in the range of 117–119 8C. The first

cooling curves indicate a lower temperature primary

crystallization exotherm peak for ‘B’ (93 8C) than the ‘H’

(95.5 8C), which in turn is slightly lower than ‘O’ (96.5 8C).

It might be postulated that a lower primary crystallization

temperature peak (higher effective degree of undercooling)

indicates crystallization of relatively smaller-sized crystals

as compared to the sample that crystallized at a higher

temperature. The slightly smaller-sized lamellar crystals

should therefore begin to melt at a lower temperature. This

is confirmed by the endotherm peak positions in the second

heating cycles, where ‘B’ shows the peak endotherm at

116.5 8C whereas ‘H’ and ‘O’ show the second melting

endotherm peaks at 117.5 8C. The second heating profiles

are shown in Fig. 8(b). A distinct ‘shoulder’ in the second

cycle melting endotherm at 109–113 8C for the ‘H’ and ‘O’

films (Fig. 8(b)) can be clearly seen in comparison to the ‘B’

film, which does not show a distinct shoulder. This

difference in the second melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ could arise from the more

interchain homogeneity of SCB in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and ‘O’, as

indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Another noticeable and

identical feature in the first and second cooling curves is the

presence of a small exotherm transition at 63 8C for each of

the three films within a given series, be it blown, quenched

or slow cooled. This secondary crystallization is postulated

to lead to the formation of a second population of lamellar

crystals that are thinner than those formed during the

primary crystallization process at higher temperatures.

The DSC results of the compression molded films are

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8829shown in Fig. 9, where only the heating curves are shown.

Based on the first heating curves (Fig. 9(a)), the melting

peaks of the quenched and slow cooled films are in the range

of 115–117 8C. Only the slow cooled films of ‘H’ and ‘O’

show a slightly broader melting endotherm than that of ‘B’.

These samples were left in the insulated DSC chamber and

allowed to cool down to room temperature in about 2 h after

which they were heated again and the corresponding second

heating curves were recorded (Fig. 9(b)). As can be seen, a

behavior similar to what was observed for the blown films is

noted. Specifically, the presence of a ‘shoulder’ on the

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ (for both quenched and

slow cooled) is much more distinct and marked as these

samples were cooled very slowly after the first melting (as

against a cooling rate of 20 8C/min for the blown films). As

stated earlier, the slightly broader first melting endotherms

of ‘H’ and ‘O’ than ‘B’ and the difference in the second

melting DSC behavior of ‘H’ and ‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’

could arise from the slightly more homogenous distribution

of SCB (along the ethylene backbone) in ‘B’ than ‘H’ and

‘O’, as indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, it

can be said that the thermal behavior based on the first

heating responses of these films ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ (be it

quenched or blown) are very similar. In the compression

molded slow cooled films, whether the slightly broader first

melting endotherms of ‘H’ and ‘O’ play a role in governing

the mechanical properties at slow deformation rates of these

films will become clear in the following discussion.

The tensile properties of the 25 mm thick blown films and

compression molded films that were measured at slow draw

rates, ca. 0.0004–0.008 m/s, (25–510 mm/min) are shown in

Fig. 10. The yield and breaking strength are essentially the

same for the films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’ in each

direction (MD or TD). For the LLDPE blown films, due to

preferential orientation of the lamellar crystals, the TD

modulus tends to be higher than the MD modulus [13].

However, for the films investigated here, the low levels of

orientation translates to the modulus being only marginally

higher along the TD. Likewise, the tensile properties of the

compression molded films (Fig. 10(b)) at conventional draw

rates indicate very comparable yield and breaking strengths

for films based on ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, within a given series.

Within the limits of error, the tensile modulus is also very

similar for films based on three resins in each series. These

results clearly indicate that the slight differences in the

TREF profiles in Fig. 3 and differences in first melting DSC

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films really do

not play any role in governing the mechanical properties

when obtained at slow deformation rates (up to 0.008 m/s).

To ascertain any differences in the tensile properties at

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378830higher deformation rates, the stress strain behavior was

measured at a higher deformation rate of 1 m/s (about two

orders of magnitude higher than before). These results are

shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b) for 25 mm thick blown and

compression molded films. Due to the extremely high rate of

data acquisition, the ‘ringing’ characteristics of the load

path’s mechanical elements (primarily the load cell/grip

assembly) appear as oscillations in the ‘yield’ region of the

curves. However, the yield strength values of both the blown

and compression molded films are readily distinguished,

and all fall in the range of 17–20 MPa. The ‘H’ and ‘O’

blown films also show a higher breaking strain than that for

corresponding ‘B’ films (Fig. 11(a)). Likewise, B–Q and

B–SC underwent failure before yielding or plastic drawing

could take place whereas, with the exception of the ‘O–SC’,

the compression molded ‘H’ and ‘O’ materials yield, draw

and undergo significant post ‘natural draw ratio’ defor-

mation before failure (Fig. 11(b)). A noticeable trend was

observed in the breaking strengths. The breaking strength of

the 1-butene based films (‘B’) is distinctly lower than that

for the 1-hexene (‘H’) and 1-octene (‘O’) based films,

regardless of film type (quenched, slow cooled or blown).

For the blown films, the ‘B’ films have a breaking strength

of ca. 21–24 MPa as compared to that of 31–36 MPa for ‘H’

and ‘O’ films. In either direction (MD or TD) the ‘H’ and

‘O’ films also show distinctly greater strain hardening when

compared to the ‘B’ films, and this accounts for the higher

values of the breaking strengths. Similarly, strain hardening

can be observed in the ‘H’ and ‘O’ compression molded

films. The quenched and slow cooled films of ‘B’ do not

undergo any strain hardening and display much lower

breaking strengths (6–10 MPa) as compared to the high

values of the ‘H’ and ‘O’ films (16–26 MPa). Note that

when the breaking strengths of the compression molded and

blown films corresponding to the same resin are compared,

the blown films have superior properties. Comparing the

results in Figs. 9 and 10, it can be inferred that the breaking

strength of blown films of ‘B’ is lower than that of ‘H’ and

‘O’, an effect that is evident only at high deformation rates.

Further tests conducted on the blown films to measure

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8831their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and

Elmendorf tear properties, where high deformation rates of

0.1–1, 0.1–7 and 0.2–4 m/s, respectively, were utilized, also

confirm this behavior. As shown in Fig. 12, the dart impact

strength, at any given film gage, of ‘B’ is significantly lower

than that of ‘H’ and ‘O’. During the dart impact testing,

some of the films, especially at higher gage, did not rupture

at the maximum allowable force corresponding to the

falling dart of 1400 g. Hence, those values are reported as

‘O1400 g’ in Fig. 12. Turning to the results in Fig. 13(a)

and (b), it is clearly noted that Elmendorf tear and Spencer

impact strength increase with increasing short chain branch

length at any given blown film thickness. Furthermore,

within samples of the same copolymer type (‘B’, ‘H’ or ‘O’)

these properties increase with increasing blown film

thickness, as would be expected. Of particular importance

is that for any given direction (MD or TD), the Elmendorf

tear strength and Spencer impact strength increase in the

order: ‘O’O‘H’O‘B’. The results of the puncture resistance

measurements on compression molded quenched and slow

cooled plaques are given in Fig. 14, which again support that

the materials based on 1-butene are inferior to those based

on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The load-deformation curves are

plotted in Fig. 14(a) for the representative samples

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’, respectively, in each

series (quenched and slow cooled). Five specimens

(quenched and slow cooled) were tested (load-deformation

curves of representative specimens shown Fig. 14(a)). The

results indicated a good reproducibility for each material

type. The average integrated energy to rupture and the

deformation to failure are plotted in Fig. 14(b). As can be

seen, within a given series, be it quenched and slow cooled,

the total deformation to failure (plotted on the secondary

axis of Fig. 14(b)), of ‘H’ and ‘O’ is higher than that of ‘B’,

indicating an increased ductile failure in ‘H’ and ‘O’. This

was also confirmed visually by the fact that the deformed

‘H’ and ‘O’ samples had a longer and ductile sleeve

(relative to that in ‘B’) that emanated from the region where

the mechanically driven tup exited the sample. This is also

reflected as higher total rupture energies for ‘H’ and ‘O’

(55–61 J) than ‘B’ (30–37 J). However, in all these tests,

viz. dart impact, Spencer impact and Elmendorf Tear the

rate of deformation of the films is not well-defined. In a dart

impact measurement, a falling dart ruptures the film held in

tension and the equivalent force to rupture is recorded in

terms of the mass of the falling dart. In the case of the

Spencer impact strength measurements, a piece of film is

held in tension and punctured with a hemispherical head

attached to a swinging pendulum whereas in Elmendorf tear

resistance, the precut film sample is ruptured by a swinging

pendulum. In the puncture resistance measurements the

sample is held in tension and punctured by a pneumatically

driven tup/dart. In either configuration, the deformation rate

of the film can be visualized to be a maximum at the

initiation (when the pendulum or the ball/dart hits the film)

and then decreases thereafter as the crack progresses (as

most of the energy carried by the pendulum or the ball/dart

has already been spent in overcoming the initial resistance).

Thus, the rates of deformation (reported above) are at best

estimates and never an exact value, as the deformation

process of the samples is not well-controlled.

To characterize the deformation of the films in a more

well-defined extensional regime, tear resistance properties

were measured by utilizing the essential work of fracture

(recall earlier discussion of this methodology). Here, precut

films that have a specified ligament length were deformed

in a tensile manner at 1 m/s to investigate their tear

resistance properties. A typical stress–displacement behav-

ior for the blown film based on resin ‘H’ is shown for two

ligament lengths, viz. 1 and 3 mm in Fig. 15(a) and (b).

(corresponding to each ligament length and marked as i, ii, iii and iv) are

shown to indicate reproducibility.

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8833Three stress–displacement curves (marked as i, ii and iii)

corresponding to three specimens (with the same ligament

length) are shown to indicate the reproducibility in the data.

The tear specimens satisfy the plane stress conditions [Eqs.

(3) and (4) in Section 2] and fail right after the yield and do

not undergo any plastic stretching that is characteristic of

the samples in a conventional tensile deformation test.

Further, the larger ligament length specimens had a larger

strain at break. This is due to the fact that at larger ligament

lengths, there is more material in the ligament that

undergoes deformation in comparison to that in the smaller

ligament lengths. However, the yield stress is practically the

same at both the ligament lengths, as expected. Stress–

displacement curves were obtained in a similar fashion for

the 25 mm thick blown films of ‘B’ and ‘O’ and all the

compression molded films. Based on the procedure outlined

in Section 2, the specific fracture energy, obtained by

integrating the stress–strain curve, was fitted by a linear

relationship when plotted against the ligament length. The

intercepts of these plots, then gave the essential work of

fracture. These results are shown in Fig. 16. For the blown

films (Fig. 16(a)) in each of the direction (MD or TD), the

essential work of fracture is observed to increase with

increasing short chain branch length, a result consistent with

the impact strength and Elmendorf tear resistance measure-

ments. As stated before, when a blown film specimen is

stretched along the MD, the crack propagates along the TD.

Therefore, when the specimen is being stretched along the

MD, the measured EWF is representative of the TD

direction. Consequently, the EWF along the TD is greater

than that along the MD. This is consistent with the tear

resistance being greater along the TD than along the MD

(Fig. 13(a)), which in turn is a manifestation of the preferred

lamellar orientation [13,14] (although only slight in this

study). For the compression molded quenched films

(Fig. 16(b)), the essential work of fracture of films based

on 1-butene was also observed to be less than that of the

1-hexene and 1-octene films. However, within the limits of

experimental error, the EWF results of the slow cooled films

do not indicate a strong dependence on the short chain












P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378834branch length. Thus, based on the results discussed so far, it

can be inferred that the mechanical properties of the films of

the three essentially identical linear low density polyethy-

lene copolymers based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene

show a dependence on the length of short chain branch only

at high rates of deformation. This is summarized in Table 3, where at slower rates of deformation, the mechanical

properties were observed to be similar but quite different at

higher deformation rates. This is due to the fact that these

films are very similar in their molecular, rheological and

structural aspects that any effects due to the different short

chain lengths (present in small amounts of ca. 2.5–3 mol%)

do not get reflected at slower deformation rates. However, at

high deformation rates, these effects become prominent

such that the mechanical properties of films based on

1-butene were observed to be lower than those based on

1-hexene and 1-octene. Recalling that the primary objective

of this study was to further investigate the effect of the

length of short chain branch on the physical properties of

LLDPEs, the results presented here have shown that the

length of the short chain branch does play an important role

in influencing the mechanical properties of the LLDPEs in

agreement with earlier results [28] and furthermore

established that this effect is pronounced only at high rates

of deformation.

With regards to the origin of the effect of the difference in

short chain branch length on the mechanical properties

when measured at high rates of deformation, it seems

difficult to attribute this to the amorphous phase in view of

the low mole percentage of the branches and the fact that the

rheological behavior of at least the melt state shows no

significant differences. We did investigate the DMA

(dynamic mechanical analysis) behavior of the film

materials (data not shown) but did not find any distinct

variations between the materials although we admit that the

DMA tests were determined in the lower frequency range

(0.001–10 Hz). We conjecture that the origin of the effect of

the difference in short chain branch length on the

mechanical properties is coupled to its influence on the

deformation behavior of the crystalline phase. It has been

speculated [21,24,62,63] that a short chain branch prevents

the formation of crystalline regions in its immediate vicinity

leading to an increased probability of the main chain to

which it is attached to be incorporated into two different

lamellae, thereby establishing that portion of the chain as a

bridge or a tie molecule. If this supposition is true, then the

enhanced properties, associated with plastic deformation

(ductility, toughness, tear resistance, etc.), could be due to

an increasing number of tie molecules with increasing molar

content of short chain branches. However, this postulate

does not explain the EWF results on slow cooled films

where the essential work of fracture was not observed to be

strongly dependent on the branch length. For the three series

of films investigated in this study, viz. the blown, quenched

and slow cooled, the latter had the slowest rate of

crystallization and hence the highest opportunity to form a

more thermodynamically desirable equilibrium structure.

Thus, if tie molecule formation is favored at longer branch

lengths that consequently result in larger values of strength,

then this effect (‘O’w‘H’O‘B’) should be more pro-

nounced in the EWF results on slow cooled in comparison to

blown and quenched films. However, this is not the case.

Therefore, it is difficult to envision the increased formation

of tie molecules with increasing short chain branch length.

We, however, postulate that during the process of

deformation at high rates (1 m/s), the length of the short

chain branch may play an important role when it is pulled

into and potentially through the chain folded lamellar

regions as they deform. A very simplified schematic of this

concept is shown in Fig. 17. The magnitude of the resistance

offered by a shorter branch length undergoing deformation

through the crystalline regions could be lower than that

experienced by a longer branch length. Furthermore, for

LLDPEs that have only a few mol% (!5 mol%) of the short

chain branch comonomer, it is possible that this effect would

be pronounced at higher rates of deformation. This is

because at lower rates (0.0004 m/s) of deformation the

polymer chains have a longer time scale to respond to the

deformation, and consequently the resistance offered by

the branch during deformation may be independent of its

length. However, while this explanation is a hypothesis that

might explain the observed phenomena, it is yet to be

confirmed. Future investigations need to be conducted to

gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of

deformation and their rate dependence at the molecular

level.

In the past, some attempts to investigate the slow crack

growth in polyethylenes have been conducted, [64–66]

P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–8837 8835however, investigating the specific behavior of the SCB

during deformation especially at a higher rate is not trivial

as the choice of a suitable experiment that will allow such a

characterization is difficult. Another potential way to

investigate such behavior at high deformation rates might

be by the dynamic modeling of the deformation phenomena

that could trace a given SCB as it is pulled through the

crystalline regions during the deformation at higher rate.

Certainly, as such modeling codes become more predictive,

the approach may help to address the distinct differences

observed in our study.

5. Summary

Three LLDPE resins synthesized by a single site

metallocene catalyst using 1-butene, 1-hexene, and

1-octene as co-monomers were characterized to be

essentially identical in terms of their molecular weight

and distribution melt rheology, density, crystallinity, and

short chain branching content. The resins were also very

homogenous with respect to the short chain branch

distribution across their MWD, although very slight

differences were observed in the TREF profiles of the

three resins. Therefore, this sample set allows us to evaluate

the exclusive influence exerted by the short chain branch

length on the physical properties of the resulting films;

many previous attempts by other workers to accomplish

the same objective have been confounded by samples

that differed substantially in their chemical composition.

The physical properties of isotropic compression molded

(slow-cooled and quenched) films as well as blown films of

the subject LLDPEs were investigated using a variety of

tests carried out at widely differing deformation rates. The

blown films made from these resins had low levels of

equivalent in-plane birefringence and the flat plate WAXS

measurements indicated low a-axis orientation along the

MD (Keller–Machin low stress row structure). Within the

compression molded quenched and slow cooled series,

the lamellar and spherulitic scale lengths as determined by

SAXS and SALS indicated very similar dimensions

corresponding to ‘B’, ‘H’ and ‘O’. The blown and

compression molded films formed from these resins were

also found to be similar to each other (within a given series,

be it blown, quenched or slow cooled) in terms of

crystallinity, and overall crystallization characteristics,

although, slightly broader melting endotherms of ‘H’ and

‘O’ in comparison to ‘B’ were observed in the first melting

profiles of compression molded slow cooled films.

However, the tensile properties of slow cooled ‘B’, ‘H’

and ‘O’at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min) were

very similar, thereby clearly indicating that these slight

differences in the TREF behavior and differences in first

melting DSC profiles of compression molded slow cooled

films really do not play any role in governing the final

mechanical properties of the LLDPE films obtained at

slower deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min).

At higher deformation rates (1 m/s), however, the

breaking strength was observed to increase with increasing

short chain branch length for all the samples investigated

(blown, quenched and slow cooled). This is consistent with

an earlier study [28] utilizing the same polymers and films










P. Gupta et al. / Polymer 46 (2005) 8819–88378836investigated here, where the impact and tear strength of

blown films based on 1-octene and 1-hexene were found to

be considerably better than those of films based on 1-butene.

While the deformation rates in the above mentioned tests are

quite high, the rates change considerably during the

measurement. Therefore, the deformation characteristics

of the subject films were also studied in a well-defined and

controlled regime by analyzing the essential work of

fracture for the blown and compressed films. For the

blown films, the essential work of fracture was found to

increase systematically with increasing short chain branch

length. For the compression molded films, the 1-hexene and

1-octene based films performed better than the 1-butene

films. In general, the mechanical properties of 1-octene

based systems were somewhat enhanced relative to those

based on 1-hexene. However, this is not an all inclusive

statement, as the compression molded films of ‘O’

performed equally to ‘H’ in high speed tensile (breaking

strength at 1 m/s), puncture resistance and EWF tear tests.

From these results, it can be concluded that the length of the

short chain branch length plays a crucial role in determining

the mechanical properties of LLDPE, especially at high

deformation rates. It is hypothesized that the magnitude of

the resistance offered by a shorter branch length undergoing

deformation through the crystalline regions could be lower

than that offered by a longer branch length. However,

further studies to gain a better understanding of the

underlying physical process of deformation need to be

conducted.

ABSTRACT: Top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene (PE)
films exposed to corona discharge display large and opposite
electrostatic potentials, forming an electric bilayer in agree-
ment with recent and unexpected findings from Zhiqiang et al.
Water wetting, chemical composition and roughness of the
two surfaces are different. Surprisingly, the bottom surface,
opposite to the corona electrode is charged but it is not
oxidized, neither is it wetted with water. Moreover, its
morphology is unaltered by charging, while the hydrophilic
top surface is much rougher with protruding islands that are
the result of oxidation followed by phase separation and
polymer−polymer dewetting. Common liquids extract the oxidized, hydrophilic material formed at the upper surface, a result
that explains the well-known sensitivity of adhesive joints made using corona-treated thermoplastics to liquids, especially water.
These results show that poling the surface closer to the corona electrode triggers another but different charge build-up process at
the opposite surface. The outcome is another poled PE surface showing high potential but with unchanged chemical
composition, morphology and wetting behavior as the pristine surface, thus opening new possibilities for surface engineering.

1. INTRODUCTION
Corona discharge is widely used in industry to improve wetting
and adhesion characteristics of polymers for applications in
adhesive bonding and printing.1−3 The surface modification is
triggered by ions formed in the air when a sufficiently large
potential difference is applied between two asymmetric
electrodes (generally, a curved and a plate electrode), creating
a large electric field that accelerates ions toward the polymer
surface. The increased adhesion and wettability of polymers
subjected to this treatment is mainly related to the introduction
of polar groups due to oxidation and other concurrent chemical
and physical changes in the surface.4−9 In a conventional corona discharge device, the curved
electrode is biased and the plate electrode is grounded.10,11 However, other geometric arrangements have been used for
specific applications. For instance, the decomposition of phenol
in water was enhanced when a stainless steel cylinder, covered
with multiwalled carbon nanotubes, was used as the grounded
electrode in a wetted-wall corona-discharge reactor.12 An
inverted configuration, where the needle is the grounded
electrode and the plate electrode is biased, was used to increase
the removal efficiency of aerosol particles from the gas using a
grounded atomizing water discharge electrode.13 The use of inverted corona setup during polymer treatment
is interesting, since the needle can be safely filled with
grounded liquids, thus being a source of ions derived from the
liquid vapor. This type of experiment is difficult to control
when using a biased needle as in the conventional geometry,
because the reduction of surface tension of the biased liquid

exiting the needle forms elongated jets that break into
droplets.14,15 It is well-known that polymer surfaces subjected to corona
treatment acquire high electrostatic potential due to the
deposition of positive or negative ions16−18 that migrate
through the atmosphere driven by the electric field until they
bind to a surface. Positive discharge provides solvated protons
[(H2O)nH

+]19 as the most abundant species, while CO3−,
NO3−, NO2−, O3−, and O2− were identified by mass
spectrometry as the main reactants formed by negative
discharge.20 Upon hitting the polymer surface, ions can trigger
the formation of unstable free radicals and ionic species.
Recent papers from Chen’s group21−23 show, using the

pulsed electroacoustic technique (PEA), that the polyethylene
surface facing the plate electrode (bottom surface) also acquires
a significant amount of charge during corona treatment.
However, the sign of charge in the bottom surface is opposite
to the sign of charge deposited on the surface facing the curved
electrode (top surface), showing that a bipolar charge injection
takes place during the corona treatment. These recent results
show that the effect of corona discharge on PE is much more
complex than previously acknowledged.
Charge carriers responsible for the top surface charging in a

corona treatment are well established in the literature,19,20 but
the mechanism of recently disclosed bottom charging has not

yet been elucidated. This is due to the well-known difficulty of
identification of charge-bearing species in electrified insula-
tors.24−32 Chen23 proposed that the charge carriers responsible for the
polyethylene bottom surface charging subjected to corona
treatment are injected from the plate electrode, being electrons
from the cathode and holes from the anode, according to the
Schottky mechanism. This can now be reinterpreted consider-
ing recent results that identify ions derived from the sample
polymers as the charge carriers in contact and tribocharg-
ing.24−26,28,32 The aim of the present work is to gather information at the
macroscopic and microscopic levels to better understand
charging processes involved in corona treatment as well as
their effect on polyethylene surfaces. The present results show,
for the first time, that the macroscopic charge bilayers, formed
during the discharge, have surfaces with different roughness,
water wetting ability, and chemical composition. Besides,
extraction with solvents reveals that common liquids dissolve
some components of the oxidized surfaces, according to their
Hildebrand parameters, and the reason for the formation of the
rough upper surface is explained considering the immiscibility
between PE and the oxidized PE formed during the corona
treatment.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Chemicals. Samples were prepared by cutting 140-μm-thick

blown LDPE films into small pieces (10 mm × 10 mm). LDPE film
identity was verified by ATR infrared, as shown in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information. Prior to use, the polyethylene samples were
immersed for 10 min in ethanol within an ultrasonic bath and then
dried at room temperature.
Reagent-grade ethanol, acetone, butanol, chloroform, toluene, and

hexane were acquired from Synth (Saõ Paulo) and used as received.
Millipore water was used throughout.
In some experiments, the bottom side of PE films pieces was coated

with ca. 10 nm Au/Pd film using a MED 020 (Bal-Tec) instrument.
2.2. Inverted Corona Discharge Treatment. The inverted

corona treatment setup used for charging the samples is schematically
represented in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. In this
configuration, the needle is grounded and the plate electrode is biased.
Preliminary observations, using the applied voltage from 4 to 7 kV,

revealed that below ±5 kV no major changes in water wettability took
place, while beyond ±6 kV, a spark discharge was observed during the
experiment. Thus, positive (+5 kV and +6 kV) and negative (−5 kV
and −6 kV) tension was applied during 3 min to the plate electrode
using a Spellman CZE 1000R power supply, while the grounded
needle was kept filled with water. The distance between the electrodes
was fixed at 6 mm, providing an electric field greater than the
breakdown strength of the air.33 The temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and the
relative humidity (50 ± 2 %RH) were controlled during the
experiments.
2.3. Electrostatic Potential Measurement. Electrostatic poten-

tial maps were obtained for corona-treated polyethylene films. The
scanning apparatus was built by Optron (Campinas). The sample
holder was an aluminum plate where the polymer film was laid. The
potential probe is a 5-mm-diameter Kelvin electrode connected to a
Trek model 347 noncontact voltmeter. This electrode is mounted on a
mechanical arm that allows it to scan the x−y plane, under
microcomputer control. The entire ensemble is mounted within a
closed metal box, which enables control of the atmospheric
composition, especially the relative humidity. The spatial resolution
of the potential measurement (5 × 5 mm2) was limited by the Kelvin
electrode dimensions and the time allowed for the electrometer to
equilibrate on each pixel was 1 s.
2.4. Allignment of Charged PE Film within an Electric Field.

Corona-treated polyethylene was exposed to the electric field

generated between two vertical parallel-plate electrodes 40 mm
apart. Voltage in one plate changed from 0 to 2 kV or from 0 to −2kV, while the other one was grounded. The film sample was placed
equidistant from both electrodes, suspended by a thin cotton thread,
and it was observed while voltage was changed. A movie was recorded
using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.5. Electric Suspension. Horizontal parallel-plate electrodes
were mounted to verify polyethylene levitation. The charged PE
sample was placed in between the two electrodes, and voltage was
gradually changed in one electrode while the other was grounded. A
movie was recorded using a Canon EOS 500D camera.

2.6. Charge Excess Measurement and Charge Excess
Simulation. Pieces of polyethylene treated by inverted corona
discharge were inserted within a Faraday cup connected to the input
of a Keithley 610C electrometer and the charge excess was
immediately read. Charge was also evaluated from electrostatic
potential measurements applying the superposition principle to a
virtual charge distribution, using a previously described proce-
dure.29−31 The total electrostatic potential (VT) generated by all
surface charges at the plane 2 mm away from a charge-carrying surface
(r = 5 mm) is thus calculated using a C2+ code for eq 1: ∑ ∑

and ε is the dielectric constant of the medium.

A squared area (5 × 5 mm2) of the electrostatic map is represented
by a 200 × 200 pixel matrix. The virtual charge distribution on the
matrix is adjusted by trial and error, until the calculated and the
experimental electric potentials in every pixel have similar values.
Then, the surface charge excess values obtained for top and bottom
polyethylene surfaces were subtracted and compared to the measured
value.

2.7. Contact Angle Measurement. Contact angle of 5 μL water
droplets deposited on corona-treated polyethylene films were
measured by the Young−Laplace (sessile drop fitting) method using
a Krüss Easydrop DSA20 instrument.

2.8. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The surface composi-
tion of corona-treated polyethylene was analyzed by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha
instrument equipped with aluminum Kα line and a VG-CLAMP-2electron hemispherical analyzer, providing an energy resolution of
∼0.85 eV. The atomic composition of the samples was determined by
integrating the core-level peaks, properly weighted by the photo-
emission cross section.

2.9. Atomic Force Microscopy. Topography and phase contrast
images of the corona-treated polyethylene films were obtained in
noncontact mode using a Shimadzu SPM-9600 microscope with a
Nanoworld silicon tip (resonance frequency = 320 kHz and force
constant = 42 N/m). The scanning system is enclosed within an
environmental chamber under controlled temperature and relative
humidity.

2.10. Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy. Solids
extracted from the film surfaces were imaged using a Libra 120 Zeiss
transmission microscope, equipped with an Omega energy filter, that
allows the acquisition of EELS (electron energy loss spectra). A
droplet of solvent used to rinse the PE surface was directly deposited
in the carbon film over a TEM sample holder grid, then dried for 30min under air, and the sample was introduced in the microscope.
Bright-field images and EELS spectra were acquired.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Macroscopic Characterization. When the needle

electrode is either positive or negative relative to the plate
electrode, PE upper surface acquires electric potential with the
same sign as the needle electrode, even when this is grounded.
Averages from triplicate surface potential measurements are

presented in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. After

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901893 either +6 kV or −6 kV under the standard and inverted corona
geometries is applied, the absolute values of electrostatic
potential measured on the top surface layer are all similar
(ranging from ±1500 to 1600 V), but with opposite signs.
The polymer surface in contact with the plate electrode

(bottom surface) also displays significant electrostatic potential,
with signal opposite to that measured on the top surface
(Figure 1). As an example, after the needle electrode is

grounded and −6 kV is applied to the plate electrode (positive
inverted corona), the electrostatic potential acquired on the
upper film side is (+1602 ± 105) V, while on the bottom, it is
(−1145 ± 49) V. Thus, the polymer layer that is in contact
with the lower plate but not directly exposed to the corona also
acquires charge, forming a positive/negative charge bilayer that
in turn creates a field measuring ca. 20 kV mm−1 across the
polymer bulk.
Observation of the charged film within an electric field

provides visible evidence of its dipolar nature. Movies 1 and 2(avi format) show a film treated by positive inverted corona
between two electrodes. After a gradual negative voltage is
applied to one electrode and the other is grounded, the film
rotates until the positive surface faces the negative electrode
and then attaches to it, as shown in movie 1. Vice versa, when
the applied voltage was set as positive (movie 2), the film
rotates so as to attach the negative surface to the positive
electrode.

To verify how the charging process works in a multilayer,
three superimposed 140 μm polyethylene films (arranged as a
sandwich) were stacked on top of the horizontal plate
electrode, and this was biased to +6 kV in the inverted corona
arrangement. Figure 2a shows the electrostatic potential

measured on each film surface. The piece that was laid in
contact with the plate electrode during the treatment (lower
film) presents positive electric potential on both surfaces, while
the upper film acquires negative potential on both surfaces.
Both sides of the middle film are charged, but one is negative
and the other is positive. Furthermore, the absolute values of
the electrostatic potential are lower than those measured for
only one film, suggesting that the charge carriers deposited on
PE during the poling process are diluted through the polymer
sandwich. This also shows that charge builds up in a film that is
isolated both from the lower electrode and from the ionized
atmosphere adjacent to the needle electrode.
Electrostatic charge excess of the polymer sandwich was also

measured, using the Faraday cup. The results shown in Figure
2b are in agreement with electric potential measurements. The
lower film has positive charge excess, while the upper film is
negative and the film that was placed in the middle of each
sandwich presents charge excess close to zero.
In other experiment, the bottom surface of polyethylene film

samples was metal-coated with Au/Pd prior to charging.
Potential on the top side of films treated by grounding the
needle and applying −6 kV to the plate electrode (inverted
positive corona) is (+1699 ± 99) V, the same as in the
uncoated samples. Nevertheless, the electrostatic potential
measured on the bottom surface is close to zero, revealing that
opposite charges are not retained on it (see Figure 3).

side levitate within a vertical electric field of ca. −200 kV/m, as
shown in Movie 3 (availabe in avi format). Non-metal-coated
samples do not levitate, even when a much higher voltage is
applied to the top electrode, probably due to the lower net
charge in the bilayer charged film.
Surface potential decay as a function of time under constant

relative humidity (70% RH) was measured for polyethylene
films treated using positive (−5 kV) and negative (+5 kV)
inverted corona. Sample scanning started immediately after
each sample was charged. Figure 4a shows the potential decay
curves from top and bottom surfaces of polyethylene treated by
−5 kV inverted corona. Both curves level off at the negative
equilibrium potential (ca. −5 V) that was recently discovered in
this research group.34 From each plot, the time required to
halve the initial potential (see Figure 4b) is obtained and
defined as the potential half-life.
Polyethylene pieces treated by positive corona present

significant difference between the half-lives measured on top
and on bottom surfaces: the half-life of the negative potential
on the bottom layer is three times longer than for the positive
potential on top surface. On the other hand, when the
polyethylene films are treated by negative corona discharge, the
half-lives measured on top (negative) and bottom (positive)
surfaces are quite similar. Altogether, these results show that
different charge-bearing species contribute to surface charging.
To determine if the charging processes alter the polyethylene

surface free energy, contact angles for water with top and
bottom surface layers were acquired as soon as the samples
were charged, and the results are shown in Table 1. Top
surfaces exposed to inverted corona discharge show contact
angle 40° lower than the untreated samples, but the bottom
surfaces are unchanged. Contact angles were followed for 60days after film charging to evaluate surface aging under air.
After 50 days aging at 60% RH, the contact angle measured on
the top surface reverted to the original values of untreated film.
A remarkable feature observed in corona-treated poly-

ethylene is that immersion in ethanol, butanol, acetone,
toluene, and chloroform easily removes top and bottom surface
charges. Films treated by positive inverted corona (−5 kV)
were immersed for 20 min in these liquids, laid on an aluminum
plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The electrostatic
potentials measured for both rinsed surfaces are in the same
range as those obtained for untreated polyethylene films,

indicating that charge suppression or extraction was fairly
complete. On the other hand, water and hexane are not good
solvents for the charge carriers, since the PE surfaces still show
a significant residual electrostatic potential after rinsing with
these two liquids (see Figure 5a).
Contact angle of polyethylene top surface is almost restored

to initial value after the charged films are rinsed with butanol,
acetone, toluene, and chloroform, as shown in Figure 5b.
Nevertheless, when the rinsing solvents are ethanol, hexane,
and water, contact angles still remain significantly lower than
the those of untreated film, showing that these liquids cannot
fully extract the oxidized surface components.
In a set of experiments, polyethylene films were corona-

charged and rinsed with ethanol, and after that, the same film
was charged again. The charging/rinsing process was repeated
five times. Electrostatic potential on PE surface reveals that
charges are removed after each ethanol rinsing, but the film

treated again.
3.2. XPS and Microscopy. XPS spectra of top and bottom

polyethylene surfaces treated by inverted corona discharge (+5kV) were obtained and then compared to the untreated sample.
Carbon and oxygen elements are present in all samples, but
after corona treatment, the oxygen content on top surface
increases from 3% to 14%, while on the bottom surface, it is
unchanged.
Atomic force microscopy was used to observe surface

morphology on top and bottom polyethylene surfaces treated
by inverted corona discharge. Topography and phase contrast
images from different areas of both sides were simultaneously
acquired, and some representative micrographs are displayed in
Figures 6 and 7. Darker regions in phase contrast images
represent more rigid domains that are less able to dissipate
mechanical energy than the brighter areas.
Both sides of untreated polyethylene (Figures 6a,b and 7a,b)

are similar. Topography is fairly smooth with maximum height
ranging from 130 to 200 nm. Moreover, the corresponding
phase images present low contrast, showing that the untreated
polymer surface is chemically homogeneous (or, at least,
viscoelastically homogeneous). Following corona treatment, the
top surface layer is modified, as shown in Figure 6c−f: taller

rigid particles or granules protrude out of the substrate,
producing higher phase contrast.
Besides, the AFM micrographs reveal that grainy pattern

formation depends on corona discharge polarity. Under −5 kV
(Figure 6c,d), small rigid granules with 10−100 nm height are
produced. However, when the plate electrode voltage is positive
(Figure 6e,f), the surface is more extensively covered by rigid
particles (height from 10 to 65 nm).
Although the corona treatment causes morphological

changes in the top side of the polymer film, no significant
variation is observed in the bottom surface layer. Images from
the bottom side, obtained after positive (Figure 7c,d) and
negative (Figure 7e,f) inverted corona treatment, do not show
the granules observed in the upper surface, nor other new
morphology features.
Another important aspect shown by AFM images is that,

after ethanol rinsing of the sample shown in Figure 6e,f, most
granular rigid material formed during corona treatment is
removed (Figure 8), leaving the surface more even and soft.
Nevertheless, the morphology of the original surface is not fully
recovered.
The extracted material from the top surface of the corona-

treated polyethylene was analyzed by electron spectroscopy
imaging in the transmission electron microscopy (ESI-TEM). A
small volume (5 μL) of ethanol used to rinse the polymer
surface was deposited on TEM sample holder, and the solvent
was then allowed to dry at room temperature. Bright-field
images (Figure 9) reveal the presence of noncontinuous film
along the substrate as well as of dendritic material (see Figure
9c) formed by dewetting. Energy-loss spectra (Figure 9d)
present only two predominant peaks: one very intense at ca.
283 eV and a low intensity peak at ca. 540 eV. These peaks are
characteristic from carbon and oxygen, respectively, and they
confirm that the extracted material is oxidized.

4. DISCUSSION
Polyethylene films treated by inverted corona discharge acquire
large but opposite electrostatic potential on top and bottom
surfaces, thus forming a charge bilayer that can also be
described as a macroscopic dipole across the polymer film (see
Figure 1). Even though corona treatment has been used for
decades, the bilayer nature of the film was observed only
recently for the first time, and the involved mechanisms are not
yet understood, but the present results allow us to present a
model for charge bilayer formation.

Dipole Formation and Oxidation. Chemical and wetting
properties of the two surfaces are different; thus, the two poling
processes responsible for the surface charging are independent
and they can be separated, as verified in the sandwich
experiment (Figure 2). Moreover, the adsorbed bottom charges
are suppressed by a conducting layer previously evaporated on
the surface, leading to the formation of a charge monolayer that
levitates in an electric field.
In the present case, the bottom surface charging process

takes place within the space charge threshold established by
Montanari et al.35,36 According to these authors, LDPE poled
within a Laplacian field only acquires charge when the field is
higher than 10 kV/mm. The electric field experienced by the
sample due to the deposited charge on the upper surface is
about 20 kV/mm, above the threshold value.
The characterization of the charge carriers adopted by

Montanari et al.36 was done by evaluating the decay rate of
positive and negative charges injected into polyethylene

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901896 surfaces. When both depletion curves have the same profiles,
the charge carriers are of the same type (electrons and holes).
However, when the curves have different profiles, there are two
families of carriers (positive and negative ions or ions and
electrons/holes). Since the electrostatic potential half-lives of
bottom surfaces exposed to negative and positive corona
discharges are very different (Figure 4b), and electro-
luminescence experiments show that the electron/hole
injection in polyethylene films occurs only at very high electric
fields,37,38 we propose that the bottom charges are from two
families of carriers. Following Montanari criteria, they are
positive ions in negative corona treatment and negative ions in
positive corona treatment.
Surface charge excess that accounts for the measured

potentials in a positive discharge (see section 2.6) are +4.9 ×
10−10 C/cm2 and −3.5 × 10−10 C/cm2 for top and bottom
surfaces, respectively; thus, the excess value for the entire piece
is +1.4 × 10−10 C/cm2, lower but in the same order of
magnitude as the value obtained by direct charge measurement

(+3.8 × 10−10 C/cm2). Assuming that the charge carriers are
ions, we can estimate a concentration of only ca. 30 ions per
μm2. Even this low charge carrier concentration leads to high
electrostatic potentials, in excess of 1000 V on each surface.
The pronounced difference between the chemical composi-

tion, roughness, and wetting behavior of the two film surfaces
show that charge carriers at the bottom surface do not derive
from oxidized polymer. We suggest that they are formed by
adsorption of negative or positive water molecule cluster ions
from the atmosphere, due to the large potential gradient
created by the ions initially deposited on the surface exposed to
corona. The hypothesis of participation of atmospheric water in
insulator charging phenomena has already been extensively
verified in polymers and other materials, in many different
experimental situations,14,29−32 and the “sandwich” experiment
(Figure 2) provides another clear verification for it, since the
charge on the polymer at the interior of the three-sheet pile
cannot be assigned to implantation of corona ions or to
electron/hole injection from the plate electrode.

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901898 surface potentials measured with Kelvin electrodes. Prior to this
work, Xiao39 observed that the effect of different solvents on
the wetting behavior of corona-treated PE depends on the
solvent used. The present results show that this can be assigned
to the extraction of charged and oxidized polymer fragments.
Toluene, acetone, n-butanol, and chloroform are all more

effective than either water or n-hexane. By plotting the ion
efficiency removal as a function of Hildebrand’s parameter40 for
these liquids, a bell-shaped curve is obtained (Figure S4 of the
Supporting Information), as usual in phenomena dependent on
mutual miscibility between a polymer and a solvent. Using this
plot, we can estimate that the Hildebrand parameter for the
surface species is in the 18−23.5 MPa1/2 range. This broad
range is probably due to the complex nature of the extracted
material that is a mixture of oxidized oligo- and macroions.
Ethanol has a peculiar behavior: it effectively extracts the

charged species from PE surface but without increasing water
contact angle back to the original value. This shows that at least

part of the oxidized species formed on the polymer surface by
corona discharge are not ions.
In addition to the solubility parameter, solvent-rinsing

experiments revealed that the polar material extracted is only
found in the outermost surface layer, since all of the charge can
be removed without detectable change in film thickness, with a
1 μm resolution. Thus, a significant part of material produced
by corona treatment is only loosely anchored in the polymer
surface.

Modified Surface Morphology. Corona charging has a
pronounced effect on the morphology of the film surface
directly exposed to corona but not on the opposite surface that
is in contact with the flat electrode. Treated top surfaces show
many granules that are mechanically stiffer than the
surrounding polymer. The granular pattern on corona-treated
polyethylene and other polyolefin was previously reported in
the literature,41−43 and its formation depends on the exposure
time, temperature, and gas composition used during the
treatment.

Langmuir Article

dx.doi.org/10.1021/la304322w | Langmuir 2013, 29, 892−901899 Kim et al.41 suggested that granule formation is caused by the
degradation of the polyethylene molecules below an inert skin,
since the gas evolved during the degradation process may cause
the topmost skin to blister. Nevertheless, Overney et al.42 explained the occurrence of droplets considering the local
surface melting of degraded products formed during corona
treatment.
According to our results, both the size of the rigid granules

(Figure S5 of the Supporting Information) and the film charge
decrease with time, suggesting that the granules contain
charged species, thus explaining the low dissipative response
of the tip while scanning the granules. This behavior is
analogous to polyelectrolyte chains in solution under low ionic
strength, which are stiffer than neutral chains.44,45 Overney et
al.42 also verified by frictional force microscopy that these
granules are more rigid, but they did not associate their stiffness
to the presence of charge.
All these observations can be understood considering that

corona discharge under air chemically modifies adjacent PE
surfaces, oxidizing them and forming a modified polymer that is
expected to be immiscible with PE, since immiscibility is the
rule among polymers. For this reason, the pristine and modified
polymer tends to phase-separate. Beyond, since the surface
tension of the oxidized polymer is necessarily higher than PE
surface tension, the oxidized surface film cannot wet bare PE
and thus it retracts or dewets,46 forming the charged granules
that are extracted with some solvents. The mechanisms
involved in the positive inverted corona discharge treatment
are schematically represented in Figure 10. 5. CONCLUSION

Corona treatment of polyethylene film produces a host of
complex modifications not only in the surface directly exposed
to corona, but also in the opposite surface. The only feature
common to both surfaces is the large (but opposite)
electrostatic potential that transforms the film into a charged
bilayer. Otherwise, the chemical composition, wetting behavior,
morphology, and response to solvents of the two film surfaces
are completely different, pointing toward two different poling
mechanisms: deposition of corona atmospheric ions on one
surface followed by adsorption of oppositely charged water
molecule clusters on the opposite surface, under the field
created by the corona ions and other ions deriving from these.
The roughness on the polymer surface exposed to corona is
due to polymer−polymer immiscibility: oxidized and charged
PE dewets the unaltered polymer due to its high surface tension
forming domains stiffened by excess charge.

Received in final form 21 June 2004 Abstract—Oxygen plasma-treated quenched and annealed polypropylene (PP) films with different
crystallinities were investigated to characterize the surface rearrangement behavior during aging using
contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Optimum plasma conditions were
examined by varying the power, time and pressure. Less crystalline quenched PP showed a larger
increase in water contact angle and a larger decrease of oxygen atomic concentration during aging
than the more crystalline annealed PP, since the oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups, introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment, oriented towards or diffused faster into the bulk with lower crystallinity.
The degree of crosslinking on the surface was enhanced after plasma treatment and, in addition to
increased crystallinity, the crosslinked structure induced by plasma treatment restricted chain mobility
and lowered the aging rate of the PP surface.

Keywords: Plasma treatment; aging; surface rearrangement.

1. INTRODUCTION

Although polypropylene (PP) possesses good mechanical and chemical properties,
its use has been restricted in various applications owing to its low surface energy.
The interest in plasma modification of polymer surfaces has gradually increased in
the plastics industry for the last 30 years, since it can improve, e.g. the wettability,
adhesion, biocompatibility and printability [1–5]. Moreover, plasma treatment can
be carried out within only a few nanometers of the surface without altering the bulk
properties of the polymer.

Although the plasma treatment of polymers has become a mature technology,
research aimed at understanding the aging behavior of treated surfaces with time
of storage is still continuing. Enhanced hydrophilicity of the PP surface can
be obtained from hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl, which can be
introduced by oxygen plasma treatment. However, a commonly observed and
troublesome phenomenon is the deterioration of the beneficial surface properties
(hydrophilicity) with aging. Such an effect is easily manifested in contact-angle
measurements where one observes an increase in contact angle on long-term
storage. It has been suggested that this hydrophobic recovery is mainly due to two
processes [2, 5–7]: reorientation of polar chemical groups towards the bulk of the
material to reduce the surface energy, and the other is the diffusion of polar chemical
groups in the polymer matrix.

This aging behavior is usually strongly affected by environmental conditions.
High temperature helps the polymer chain to move freely and accelerate the surface
rearrangement. On the other hand, in a high humidity, the water molecules are
adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface and these water molecules disturb the rotation
or diffusion of polar groups [1, 2, 6].

The surface rearrangement due to reorientation and diffusion at the surface can
be reduced by limiting the mobility of polymer chains. The chain mobility mainly
occurs in an amorphous region and the mobility in a crystalline region is fairly
limited because of an orderly packed structure [8–11]. With highly crystalline
polymers, hydrophobic recovery would be reduced because the highly restricted
chain mobility in the crystalline region would hinder the rotational and translational
motions in the surface region after plasma treatment. Thus the restricted chain
mobility decreases the aging rate of the hydrophilic surface with a crystalline
polymer.

The surface changes after plasma treatment were investigated using X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact-angle measurements. The effect of
crystallinity on aging was studied with quenched and annealed PP. The degree of
crosslinking was examined after plasma treatment by measuring the gel content and
the effect of crosslink density on aging was also investigated.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.1. Materials

Isotactic polypropylene (PP, Mw 250 000) was supplied in the form of pellets by
Daehan Yuwha (Ulsan, South Korea). These pellets were pressed and formed into
thin sheets (0.5 mm) on stainless steel plates at 220◦C for 10 min with a mould
force of 50 kN. The molded sheets were then cleaned thoroughly in an ultrasonicator
using a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture for 20 min, dried using compressed air and stored
in a vacuum desiccator with 20% RH at room temperature.

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1281 2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Determination of crystallinity. The crystallization process was conducted
after molding the PP samples. To prepare low-crystallinity PP, molten PP films im-
mediately after molding were quenched into liquid nitrogen to reduce crystalliza-
tion of the polymer. Thermal treatment for a long time (24 h) at high temperature
(145◦C) was carried out to increase the degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity
of the above two PP samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) according to the standard procedure mentioned in the literature [12]. The
empirical heat of fusion for 100% crystalline PP was set at 187 J/g [13]. The crys-
tallinity was also obtained by wide-angle X-ray scattering spectra from X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD). As the crystallinity determined from DSC or XRD does not repre-
sent surface crystallinity, so surface crystallinity was determined using the grazing
incident angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) at 8C1 beamline of PAL (Pohang Accelera-
tion Laboratory). An incident angle of 0.1◦ was selected for GIXD and the depth of
penetration (τ ) at 0.1◦ grazing angle was calculated to be 100 nm from the following
equation [14]:

τ = sin2 θ − sin2 ψ

2µ sin θ cos ψ
(α = θ + ψ), (1) where α is the angle of incidence, θ is one-half the scattering angle, ψ is the tilt
angle and µ is the linear absorption coefficient. The crystallinities of quenched and
annealed PP obtained from DSC, XRD and GIXD are shown in Table 1. 2.2.2. Plasma treatment of PP samples. Cleaned PP samples were treated
with oxygen plasma using a home-made capacitively-coupled plasma generator
operating at 13.56 MHz. To obtain the optimum conditions (power, time and
pressure), plasma-generating conditions were varied and the following optimum
conditions were selected from the results of water contact-angle measurements:
power, pressure and treatment time of 110 W, 3.33 Pa (2.5 × 10−2 Torr) and
60 s, respectively. Following the plasma treatment, the samples were washed
ultrasonically in a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture to remove the low-molecular-weight

materials generated from chain scission and then dried. For the aging studies, the
samples were stored in desiccators for 30 days.

2.2.3. Contact-angle measurements. Contact-angle measurements on the
plasma-treated samples were performed at ambient temperature by the sessile drop
method with a contact-angle goniometer (CA-A, Kyowa Surface Science, Japan).
The equilibrium contact angle of water on untreated PP was found to be 100◦. An
average of at least six readings was reported in each case. The error limit in the
measurement of contact angle was around ±0.5◦. The contact angle of n-octane
in water was measured using the transparent glass cell and doubly bent needle as
shown in Fig. 1 to investigate the change in PP surfaces in the water environment.

2.2.4. XPS analysis. The chemical surface atomic composition of plasma-treated
polymer samples was investigated by XPS. The measurements were performed with
a Perkin-Elmer PHI-5400 Photoelectron Spectrometer using Mg Kα X-ray source
(1253.6 eV, 350 W). The C1s and O1s spectra of the samples were recorded with
0.2 eV interval energy. The C1s spectra of the untreated and oxygen plasma-treated
quenched PP are shown in Fig. 2. The operating pressure during analysis was in the
range of 10−9 Torr. Angle-resolved XPS measurements were carried out at take-off
angles of 20◦ (3.4 nm depth) and 90◦ (10 nm depth) for depth profiling of the treated
surfaces both before and after aging, and sampling depth for each take-off angle was
calculated from equation (2) [1, 16, 17]:

ζ = 3λ sin θ, (2) where ζ is the sampling depth, λ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) and θ is the
take-off angle. The mean free path of photoelectrons emitted from the samples was
calculated using equation (3):

λ = 0.11ρ−1E0.5k , (3) D

where ρ is the density of polymer (PP = 0.9 g/cm3) and Ek is the kinetic energy
of photoelectron. Initial XPS analysis was carried out 2 h after plasma treatment
because it took 2 h to stabilize the pressure (below 10−9 Torr) in the main chamber.
C1s and O1s spectra were obtained after 1, 2, 13 and 30 days to observe the decay of
oxygen containing species on the surface. Atomic concentration of oxygen (Coxygen)
was calculated from respective peak areas of assumed Gaussian–Lorentzian curves
using the following equation:

The carbon (Acarbon) and oxygen (Aoxygen) areas were calculated using the PC
software, ‘PeakFit’, and the atomic sensitivity factors (S) based on peak area
measurement were taken as 0.296 for C1s and 0.711 for O1s to normalize the
intensities of the signals [18].

2.2.5. Measurement of gel content. Gel content was measured before and after
oxygen plasma treatment. PP films trapped in the mesh basket made of stainless
steel wire were dissolved in hot naphthalene (170◦C) for 12 h according to ASTM
D 2765. The residual weight of PP in the mesh was measured, and since this
residue was mainly from the crosslinked structures, the degree of crosslinking was
determined from the gel content.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Plasma process conditions

Power, time and pressure are important factors which affect the hydrophilicity of
polymer samples, because the density and the energy of ions impinging on the
sample surface depend on these parameters [19–21]. Figure 3 shows the water
contact angles on oxygen plasma-treated PP under various treatment powers and
times at 3.33 Pa. To obtain the lowest water contact angle, meaning the highest

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1285 hydrophilicity of surface, a longer time or high power was required. As the
treatment time decreased, more power was needed to obtain a water contact angle
under 10 degrees. Low power cannot generate high density of ions with an energy
higher than the bond energy of C H to generate radicals on the PP surface and,
thus, longer treatment time can increase the number of radicals.

The effect of pressure on the oxygen plasma treatment of PP is shown in the
Fig. 4 with 100 W for 2 min. The water contact angle decreased as the pressure
dropped and the lowest water contact angle was observed at 3.33 Pa. At lower
chamber pressures, the mean free paths of the ions and electrons are longer, and
the ions can strike the surface with a relatively low loss of kinetic energy. At
high pressure, however, the intensity of collisions between the ions and the neutral
molecules increases, with the particles losing kinetic energy before colliding with
the surface, resulting in low generation of radicals [21]. Below the pressure of
3.33 Pa, the water contact angle increased, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. At too
low pressure, the number of particles (neutral molecules) is low and the generation
of ions is little, since ions are generated from the collision of electrons with neutral
molecules. Even if the ions strike the surface of the polymer without loss of kinetic
energy, the number of collisions between the ions and the surface is not high and
there are not enough radicals formed on the surfaces.

From the above experiment, 3.33 Pa pressure, 1 min time and 110 W Rf power
were chosen as optimum process conditions and all oxygen plasma treatments were
carried out under these conditions.

3.2. XPS results

The surfaces of the oxygen plasma treated PP samples were characterized with XPS
(Fig. 5). Before aging, the oxygen concentration of the surface with 20◦ take-off
angle (approx. 3.4 nm depth) was 10% more than that of the surface with 90◦ take-
off angle (approx. 10 nm). The decrease of oxygen concentration with increasing
depth from the surface reveals that reactions of polymer chains with oxygen plasma
occurred in a very shallow surface region. For the generation of oxygen species,
carbon radicals had to be formed by the accelerated oxygen ions in the plasma and
reaction with the molecular oxygen. Since the oxygen ions could not penetrate
into the deep surface region and the molecular oxygen could not diffuse into the
bulk layer easily, the oxygen concentration of the oxygen plasma-treated PP surface
decreased with increasing take-off angle.

Annealed PP, having higher crystalline fraction, had lower concentration of
atomic oxygen than quenched PP having lower crystalline fraction. The higher
degree of oxygenation of the low crystalline sample indicates a greater chemical
reactivity of the sample with plasma. It appeared that the reaction intermediates

Aging behavior of oxygen plasma-treated PP with different crystallinities 1287 (mainly the radicals) were relatively more mobile in the polymer matrix having
lower crystalline fraction and, hence, are expected to react more easily with the
oxygen ions in the plasma [22]. Morra et al. have reported the influence of
crystallinity on the plasma modification of the polymer surface [5]. They concluded
that higher reactivity of the polymer, having lower crystalline fraction, was due to
greater freedom of motion granted by higher percentage of amorphous domains of
the polymer.

During aging, both quenched and annealed PP samples showed similar decrease
of oxygen concentration and the change was not much in the sampling depth of
10 nm (90◦ take-off angle). After 30 days of aging there was 8% decrease in oxygen
concentration with quenched PP, but only 4% decrease with annealed PP in the
sampling depth of 3.4 nm (20◦ take-off angle). This represents, that in the surface
depth around 3.4 nm, the migration of polar functional groups of the annealed PP
is much reduced due to higher crystallinity. Increase in crystallinity hinders the
movement of the polymer chains and, therefore, slows down the aging process due
to higher structural regularity and lower free volume in the polymer matrix [8, 23].

3.3. Contact angle variation with aging

As shown in Fig. 6, an increase of water contact angle on oxygen plasma-treated PP
was observed during aging in air. The modified hydrophilic polymer surface after
oxygen plasma treatment became hydrophobic again to reduce the interfacial free

energy between the surface and its environment. Hydrophilic groups introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment oriented towards or diffused into the bulk, and the
surface became hydrophobic. In the water condition, however, the surface of oxygen
plasma-treated PP was stable, since the difference in interfacial energy was not
high. Before oxygen plasma treatment, because PP was originally hydrophobic,
the contact angle of n-octane having similar surface energy as PP was low. But the
contact angle of n-octane was high after plasma treatment and it stayed constant
during aging in the water condition. In water, the hydrophilic groups formed by
plasma treatment did not reorient towards or diffuse into the bulk. The slight
decrease of contact angle of n-octane after 1 day aging was due to dissolution of
low-molecular-weight materials (LMWM) formed by plasma treatment. The loss
of LMWM having hydrophilic groups on the surface decreased the surface energy
of PP and hence the contact angle of n-octane.

From water contact angle measurements the amount of polar groups formed can
be estimated in the surface region (depth 0.5 nm) after plasma treatment [24, 25].
Although the contact angles on quenched and annealed PP were almost the same
(10◦) just after plasma treatment, there was more increase with less crystalline,
quenched PP during aging, as shown in Fig. 7. The increase was smaller for the
more crystalline, annealed PP and the retention of hydrophilicity was also relatively
high. The increase of contact angles after aging was interpreted as a result of
migration of polar groups away from the surface to the bulk (depth 0.5 nm). The

sharp increase of contact angle within 24 h was similar to the sharp decay of atomic
oxygen concentration determined from XPS in the depth of 3 nm.

The fraction of immobile polar groups (fim) was calculated using the equation
suggested by Hyun, and the fim values are shown in Table 2 [11]. Chatelier
et al. have defined ‘immobile’ polar groups as those that cannot participate in
polymer chain motions transporting the polar groups beyond the range of interfacial
potentials [24]. The polymer surface with a higher fim persisted to have a low
contact angle after long periods of aging due to the restricted polymer chain
movement in the well-ordered crystalline region. From the fim value of oxygen
plasma-treated PP, it was observed that the amount of immobile polar groups
(fim) of annealed PP was higher than those of quenched PP due to higher surface
crystallinity. These immobile polar groups with limited movement caused a low
rate of decay of oxygen containing species with more crystalline PP in the XPS
experiment. The decrease of hydrophobic recovery with the increase of crystallinity
is due to the restriction imposed on the loss of polar surface groups by the ordered
crystalline environment.

3.4. Crosslinking after plasma treatment

In spite of the difference in crystallinity more than 10% between annealed and
quenched PP, the more crystalline PP had only 5◦ lower water contact angle and
2% higher oxygen atomic concentration after 30 days aging. Also the fraction of
the immobile polar groups of more crystalline PP was not much more than that of
less crystalline PP. If the crystallinity was the only factor affecting the mobility
of polymer chains, the differences in water contact angle and oxygen atomic
concentration between quenched and annealed PP after aging would be much larger.
Therefore, we measured the gel content change after oxygen plasma treatment
(Table 3), and observed that the degree of crosslinking of less crystalline PP was
higher than that of more crystalline PP. Usually the formation of a three-dimensional
network is a well-known consequence of a polymer by inert gas plasma treatment,
and the reaction mechanisms were illustrated by Poncin-Epaillard and co-workers as
shown in Fig. 8 [27, 28]. The combination of radicals obtained after elimination of
CH3 could form the crosslinked structure. A higher degree of crosslinking formed in

low crystallinity PP limited the mobility of chains and, thus, reduced the difference
in surface rearrangements between low and high crystallinity PP.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The surface rearrangement of polypropylene (PP) having different crystallnities was
studied after oxygen plasma treatment using XPS and contact-angle measurements.
Less crystalline PP had a higher susceptibility to attack by plasma and had a higher
oxygen concentration on the surface because of the more amorphous fraction on
its surface. But during aging, the more crystalline PP had lower water contact
angle and higher oxygen concentration than the less crystalline PP. The mobility
of polar groups was reduced with increase of degree of crystallinity. After oxygen
plasma treatment, an enhancement of crosslinking was observed and the crosslinked
structure on the surface limited the reorientation and diffusion of polar functional
groups into the bulk.
