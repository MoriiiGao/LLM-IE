Title: Decreased Thermal Conductivity of Polyethylene Chain Influenced by Short Chain Branching In this paper, we have studied the effect of short branches (side chains) on the thermal conductivity (TC) of a polyethylene (PE) chain. With a reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method, TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. It shows that the branch has a positive effect to decrease the TC of a PE chain. The TC of the PE-ethyl chain decreases with the number density increase of branches, until the density becomes larger than about eight ethyl per 2   seg- ments, where the TC saturates to be only about 4 % that of a pristine PE chain. Because of different weights, different branches will cause a different decrease of TCs, and a heavy branch will lead to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC. [DOI: 1 .1115/1.4 38  3]

1 Introduction


Not only a high thermal conductivity (TC) but also a quite low TC is desired for polymers because of their wide applications [1–6], such as a high TC for application as a thermal interface material [7,8] and a low TC for application as a thermal insulation material. Single polymer chains and highly aligned polymer fibers have attracted a wide attention due to their potential high TC [9–16]. Although a single polymer chain may possess a high TC, polymers are generally regarded as a thermal insulator because of their very low thermal conductivities on the order of  .1 W m1 
K1 [17]. One of the reasons for the low TC is that the polymer chains are randomly coiled in the polymers, which effectively shortens the mean free path (MFP) of heat-carrying phonons [18,19]. Another reason is that the TC of these polymers can be significantly influenced by the morphology of individual chains [14–17,2 –22]. Besides these two reasons, the method to further decrease the TC of a polymer is still desired to develop a thermal insulator.


There have already been some methods to reduce the TC of a polymer chain. Liao et al. [23] tuned the TC of a polymer chain by atomic mass modifications and found that heavy substituents hinder heat transport substantially. Robbins and Minnich [16] found that even perfectly crystalline polynorbornene has an exceptionally low TC near the amorphous limit due to extremely strong anharmonic scattering. Most recently, Ma and Tian [24] studied the influence of the side chains on the TC of bottlebrush polymers, and predicted that side chains dominate the heat con- duction and could lead to a lower TC. Some other studies also shown that chain segment disorder, or the random rotations of segments in a chain, will lead to a lower TC [15,25–28].


In this paper, we take the effect of branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a polymer. Considering the com- plex structure of a polymer, we just focus on the polyethylene (PE) chain. Results turn out that the TC of a PE chain with branches can be decreased to be only 4 % that of a pristine chain. The paper is organized as follows: first, a reverse nonequilibrium


molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method is introduced; and then the effects of backbone chain length, branching chain location, branching chain type, and the number density of branching chains are simulated and discussed. This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.


2 Simulation Method


The materials studio is applied to build the initial configuration of the PE chain and the modified PE chain. The PE chain is estab- lished by replicating the PE segments which is the unit cell of PE’s idealized bulk lattice structure with a length of 2.5 7 Å. The schematic structures of a pristine PE chain and a PE-ethyl chain are shown in Fig. 1. After building the PE chain, with the COM- PASS II potential [29–32], we first relax the system in an NVT (constant number of atoms, temperature, and volume) ensemble at a temperature of 3   K for 125 ps, where the Nose–Hoover ther- mostat [33,34] is applied to obtain the constant temperature. And then, a NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy) ensemble is used to release the thermal stress. In the simulation process, we double-check that the total energy has reached mini- mum and becomes unchangeable at the end of NVT and NVE ensembles to make sure that our systems have already been equilibrated.


To calculate TC, the RNEMD [35,36] simulation is performed on the well equilibrated structures to establish a temperature gra- dient. In the RNEMD method, each of the simulation boxes is divided into several slabs with a periodic boundary in the heat transfer direction. As that shown in Fig. 2, the simulation system is divided into several slabs (2  to 2   slabs, depending on the chain length), slab   is the “hot” slab, and the slab N/2 is the “cold” slab. Other slabs are used to obtain the temperature distri- butions. The heat flux is created by exchanging velocities of par- ticles in cold and hot slabs. The cold slab donates its “hottest” particles (particles with the highest kinetic energy) to the hot slab in exchange for the latter’s “coolest” particles (particles with the lowest kinetic energy). Performing this exchange periodically results in the heating up of the hot slab and cooling down of the cold slab. This process eventually yields a steady-state tempera- ture gradient due to thermal conduction through slabs separating the cold and hot slabs. The TC is calculated exactly by the relationship

where the sum is taken over all transfer events during the simula- tion time t, m is the mass of the atoms, and c and h are the velocities of the identical mass particles that participate in the exchange procedure from the cold and hot slabs, respectively. A is the cross-sectional area which is selected to be 14.7 Å2 with a branch-caused uncertainty less than 1.6% as listed in Table 1. Such a small difference between cross-sectional areas will not lead to a large TC difference as that caused by branches (will be discussed later). The TC present in this work could be scaled by a different cross-sectional area for a comparison. With a time-step


of 1 fs, a total simulation time of  .1 ns is taken to get a good lin- ear temperature distribution. The temperature which is adopted to calculate the temperature gradient is averaged through every 1    simulation steps (1 ps). The temperature fluctuation in the simula- tion can be reduced by this average method. With heat flux printed out every  .1 ps, the TC is calculated at the last step. The tempera- ture distribution in a PE chain with a length of 1   segments is shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The linear temperature region is fitted to obtain the temperature gradient for the calculation of the effective TC by using the Fourier’s law. The TC calculated at dif- ferent simulation times is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that  .1 ns is long enough to get a converged TC.


3 Results and Discussion


First, the length dependence of the TC of a pristine PE chain is investigated and compared with that in early researches. And then, the TC of the pristine PE chains with different lengths is compared with that of a PE-ethyl chain. Third, the effect of the branch arrangement is considered. Finally, the influence of the branch type and the number density of branches are taken into account.


3.1 Length Dependence of TC. Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain with different chain lengths at 3   K are first simulated and presented in Fig. 4(a). Previous works [14,37,38] about the pristine PE chains are also added in Fig. 4(a) for com- parison. As that shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an obvious increase of the TC with the increase of the chain length. Even with the length increasing to be 2   nm, the TC still not converges, which sug- gests that some portion of the phonons can still travel ballistically

in such a length. Our simulation work confirms that the TC of a pristine PE chain will increase with the increasing number of seg- ments (or chain length), and the TC of a single PE chain is several orders of magnitude larger than that of a PE polymer. In Fig. 4(a), the TC difference between different works should be attributed to the application of different simulation methods, considering that the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method is applied in our and the work of Hu et al. and the equilibrium molecular dynamics method is utilized in the work of Ni et al. and Liu and Yang. It seems that a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method will give a higher TC than an equilibrium molecular dynamics method. This was also noticed in other studies [39,4 ], and some explana- tions can be found there.


Plotting 1/k against 1/L in Fig. 4(b), we can see that with the increase of 1/L, the 1/k first increases rapidly and then saturates to a linear increase. The method by extrapolating the linear relation- ship between the inverse of the TC (1/k) and the inverse of the sample length (1/L) to get the TC with an infinite length fails. This failure is attributed to the divergent thermal conductivity at 1/L!   where 1/k!  , which has already been carefully studied and explained with theoretical and molecular dynamics methods in Ref. [41], more details can be found there.


Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain and the PE- ethyl chain with lengths ranging from 1   to 5   segments (or 25. 7–125.35 nm) are compared in Fig. 5. It turns out that both TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain increase with the increasing length, and the TC of a PE-ethyl chain is only about 75% that of a pristine PE chain. To illustrate the underlying mech- anism of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain, the vibrational den- sity of states (VDOS) is calculated by using the Fourier transform


of the velocity autocorrelation function. Results are compared between the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain with 5  seg- ments, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering the low-frequency (<2  THz) phonons dominate the TC due to their high group velocities and long MFPs [23], the lower VDOS of the PE-ethyl chain in the low frequency should be responsible for the lower TC, where the branch acts as a center of low-frequency-phonon scattering.


To further illustrate the phonon scattering caused by the branch- ing chains, the phonon spectral energy density (SED) of the pris- tine PE and PE-ethyl chains is calculated based on the velocity output of MD simulations. The atomic velocities are obtained by a NVE simulation at a temperature of 3   K. The frequency resolu- tion is selected to be  . 1 THz with  .1 ns NVE simulations, and the wave-number is  . 2j/(2p/a), where j¼ 2pn/aN, here a is the lattice constant, N is the total number of unit cells along the heat transfer direction (N¼ 5  in this work), and n is an integer ranging from   to N 1. More details about the calculation can be found in Refs. [42–45]. Results are shown in Fig. 7 with the shading sig- nifying the magnitude of the SED. The SED of a pristine PE chain in Fig. 7(a) coincides with that in Ref. [16] which confirms the reliability of our calculation. For each phonon mode in Fig. 7, the range of frequencies is related to the anharmonicity of the poten- tial and the rate of the phonon scattering. The situation when branch atoms move far away from equilibrium positions may lead to a significant broadening of the peaks in Fig. 7. Fitting the shape of peak and valley profiles of SED at all branches to the Lorent- zian function [42–45], the phonon relaxation time is obtained and shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the magnitude of the phonon relaxa- tion time is greatly reduced by branching chains, which should be

responsible for the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain. The redistribu- tion of phonons and the smearing acoustic branches of the PE-ethyl chain in Fig. 7(b) proves the result in Fig. 8 that there is a more severe phonon scattering for a PE-ethyl chain than a pris- tine PE chain.


3.2 Influence of Branch Arrangements. The influence of branch locations is considered in this part. For a pristine PE chain, there are different locations from the simulation region boundary to the branching ethyl. Five special locations are selected to branch a short chain, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respec- tively, as that shown in Fig. 9(a). The result in Fig. 9(b) confirms that the presence of a branching chain can truly reduce the TC, and the average TC of a PE-ethyl chain is about  .7 times that of a pristine PE chain. Our simulations also indicate that there is almost a same TC for different locations in Fig. 9(b). This is attributed to the periodic boundary condition in the simulation. The small TC discrepancies between different locations should be caused by the different distance of the branch from the simulation boundary. If the boundary and the branching chains are both thought as defects on a pristine PE chain, the TC with ethyl located at the middle of the chain (P1) will be lower than other TCs (P2, P3, P4, and P5), because of the small distance from the

middle of the chain to the system boundary. This is confirmed by results in Fig. 9(b).


3.3 Influence of Branching Chain Types and Number Den- sity of Branches. Seven different types of short chains are branched on the middle segment of a PE chain, respectively, for comparisons. They are different from the weight and the type of chemical bonds between the backbone and the branch, as shown in Fig. 1 , which are listed as phenoxy group, phenyl group, ethoxy group, methoxy group, ethyl group, ethylene group, and hydroxy group, respectively. The black, red, and blue columns in Fig. 1  stand for different chain lengths. The relative masses of different branches are also shown in Fig. 1 . We can see that all types of branches can lead to a decrease of TC, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one, except for the ethyl- ene group for which TC may be further decreased by a different bond. It agrees with the conclusion in Ref. [23] that a chain modi- fied by a heave atom possesses a lower TC than that modified by a light one, where the modifying atom can be thought a special short branch. We conclude that different branches will lead to a different decrease of thermal conductivities because of the differ- ent weights. More studies are still needed to probe the effect of bonds between the backbone and the branch on the TC.


The effect of the number density of branches is studied in this part. The number density of branches is defined as the number of branches divided by the number of PE segments. Two hundred segments (5 .14 nm) are applied as a periodic unit in the simula- tion, and the ethyl group is selected as the branch. Considering there are different locations on a PE chain to branch an ethyl group, we only consider two special location arrangements, i.e., the aligned arrangement and the fork arrangement, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). For the aligned arrangement of ten branching ethyl, they are equally distributed on the PE chain, only a part of the chain is shown in Fig. 11(a); for the fork arrangement of ten branching ethyl, every two branching ethyl are located at the same segment of the PE chain, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). The corre- sponding TC of these two arrangements is shown in Fig. 11(b). It shows that a larger number density of branches leads to a lower TC for both arrangements. With an increase of the number density of branches, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain finally converges to be only about 4 % that of the pristine PE chain. This can be under- stood by that with the increase of the number density, the distance between branches is reduced, and the long-MFP phonons will be decreased until the TC converges to a constant value. It can be predicted that if a PE-ethyl chain instead of a pristine PE chain is used to build up a polymer, the TC of the polymer will be much reduced, because of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain and the additional mass of branches. What kind of a chain will lead to a lower TC is the key point of this paper, and more studies are still needed to figure out the effect of long branches on the TC of a pristine chain [24].


4 Conclusions


It is desirable to further reduce the TC of a polymer for devel- oping a thermal insulation material. In this paper, we take branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a chain. With the RNEMD method, the TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. Influences of the chain length, branch arrangements, types, and number density of branches are considered. Our results suggest that the branch has a positive effect to reduce the TC of a PE chain. If the number den- sity of ethyl branches becomes larger than eight ethyls per 2   segments, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain converges to be only about 4 % that of a pristine PE chain. This conclusion will not be influ- enced by the branch arrangements. Different branches cause a dif- ferent decrease of thermal conductivities because of their different weights, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.
