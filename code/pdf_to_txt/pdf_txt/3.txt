ABSTRACT


The crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers and molecular orientation of


polymer have long been considered to be significant influencing factors on the


thermal conductivity of polymer materials, but more clear-cut understanding on


their impact on the thermal conductivity is still needed. In this work, poly-L-


lactide (PLLA), whose crystallinity and orientation can be adjusted in a wide


range, is selected to discuss the effect of degree of crystallinity and orientation


on the thermal conductivity of PLLA. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature


on the thermal conductivity is also discussed. PLLA compression-molded


samples were heat-treated at 12  C to tune the crystallinity of the samples,


while the degrees of orientation were tuned by stretching the amorphous PLLA


bars at 6  C to different strains. It is found that environmental temperature of


application affects the thermal conductivity obviously and the glass transition


temperature of polymers shows a strong influence on the thermal conductivity


of PLLA. Below Tg, the thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity


increases with temperature and when the temperature is higher than Tg, the


thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity decreases remarkably.


It is also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of PLLA increases with the


increase in crystallinity, and the tensile strain linearly increases the thermal


conductivity in the direction of molecular orientation and decreases the thermal


conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which are in agreement with other


semicrystalline polymers that has been reported.

Polymers


Introduction


With the rapid development of science and tech-


nologies, electric products are more and more highly


integrated, which urgently pushes the exploitation of


effective thermal management materials including


thermally conductive polymers and polymer com-


posites to be applied in various applications [1–7],


such as packaging, electronic devices and energy


storage. However, bulk polymers generally exhibit


very low thermal conductivity (TC) in the range of


 .1– .5 W/(mK) [8, 9], so the development of poly-


mer materials with enhanced thermal conductivity


has become a great challenge to meet great increasing


demands [1 –15]. It has been accepted that the


polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the overall TC


of polymer composites [16]. It is therefore necessary


to clearly clarify the influence of important factors


such as crystallinity and molecular orientation on the


TC of polymers.


Generally, crystalline polymers exhibit higher TC


than amorphous polymers due to the ordered struc-


ture, while the random chain conformation in amor-


phous polymers reduces the phonon mean free path


and causes phonon scattering [17]. In early study,


Hansen et al. [18] reported that the TC of high density


polyethylene can be improved by increasing the


crystallinity and lamellar thickness via tuning pro-


cessing conditions. Subsequently, Choy and co-


worker [19] found that the influence of crystallinity


on the TC of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was


affected by temperature. The TC of PET decreases


with increasing crystallinity at low temperature, but


increases with crystallinity at temperatures above


3  K. The peculiar behavior was interpreted from the


increasing thermal boundary resistance due to


acoustic mismatch at amorphous–crystalline interface


when the temperature is lowered. Crystallization was


also reported to be responsible for the higher TC in


other semicrystalline polymers [2 , 21]. The higher


the crystallinity, the higher the thermal conductivity.


As heat transports more easily along polymer


chains than perpendicular to the polymer chain,


polymers exhibit significant anisotropy in their ther-


mally conductive properties [22]. Numerous experi-


mental studies on polymer chain orientation for TC


enhancement have been reported. As a typical


semicrystalline polymer, polyethylene (PE) has been


mostly used to study the effect of orientation on TC


[18, 23–28]. TC of other semicrystalline polymers


stretched to different draw ratio including poly-


oxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP),


polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET was also


studied [29]. The general result is that TC parallel to


the orientation direction rapidly increases with


increasing strain or draw ratio, while TC perpendic-


ular to the orientation direction decreases slightly.


But in these studies on the effect of the orientation,


TC was also influenced by the crystallization nature


of the polymers. To clarify how chain alignment


affects TC during drawing, purely amorphous poly-


mers were studied [3 –34]. Early studies [31, 32] 
showed that the TC of stretched polymethyl


methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can be


increased in the stretching direction, but the increase


was small. However, it was found recently that


polythiophene nanofibers can achieve a TC up to


4.4 W/(m K), more than 2  times greater than the


bulk polymer through chain alignment [34]. Lu et al.


[35] also evidenced the molecular alignment in


amorphous region played a very important role in


the enhancement of thermal conductivity of


semicrystalline polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber.


PLLA is a plant-derived biodegradable polymer


material. However, low thermal conductivity restricts


its application in engineering and electronic fields. To


expand the applications of PLLA, many studies have


been conducted to improve the TC of PLLA via


compounding with thermally conductive fillers


[36–41], but the basic influencing factors from the


polymer itself have not been well addressed, which is


hopefully to provide supporting for fabrication of


high thermally conductive PLLA composites. Also,


owing to that PLLA exhibits very low crystallization


kinetics [42–44], the amorphous state by quenching


and a wide range of degrees of crystallinity by


isothermal crystallization at different temperature for


different periods of time can be easily achieved [45].


These features provide a good candidate to elucidate


the effect of crystallinity and molecular orientation on


the TC of semicrystalline polymers.


In this study, the crystallinity of PLLA was tuned


by melt crystallization at 12  C for different minutes.


Various degrees of orientation of PLLA were realized


by stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 6  C with


the same speed to different strains. WAXD was car-


ried out to characterize the crystallinity and degree of


orientation of PLLA. DSC, density measurement and


laser flash method were performed together to reveal


1 544 J Mater Sci (2 18) 53:1 543–1 553 
the relation between TC and crystallinity, tempera-


ture and orientation of molecular chains. The results


showed that TC of PLLA with different crystallinity


was affected obviously by ambient temperature and


the maximum value appeared at Tg. TC of PLLA


increases with increasing crystallinity, and TC of


PLLA parallel to the orientation direction increases


with increasing tensile strain, while the one perpen-


dicular to the stretching direction decreases with


increasing strain. These results can further manifest


the effect of crystallinity and orientation on the


thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers.


Also, this systematic study can provide supporting


for fabricating enhanced thermally conductive PLLA


composites.


Experimental section


Materials and sample preparation


PLLA (trade name 4 32D, Nature Works LLC) was


used. The average weight molecular weight (Mw) and


the polydispersity index (PDI) are 2.1 9 1 5 g/mol


and 1.7. The melting temperature is 167.2 C, mea-


sured by differential scanning calorimetry at a heat-


ing rate of 1  C/min.


PLLA granules were dried in a blast drying oven at


6  C for 12 h, and then melted in the mixer of a


torque rheometer with a rotational speed of 5  rpm at


19  C for 5 min. After that, the resulted materials


were compressed into sheets with the thickness of


about  .5 mm at 19  C for 3 min under a pressure of


1  MPa. The melted PLLA sheet was immediately


transferred to isothermal crystallization at 12  C for


different minutes ( , 5, 8, 1 , 11, 12, 13 and 4  min)


under a pressure of 1  MPa and then cooled quickly


to obtain samples with different crystallinity. The


resulted samples were designated as 12 -X min, in


which X stands for the compression time at 12  C. Round disks with the diameter of 12.7 mm were cut


from the 12 -X min PLLA sheets for WAXD and


thermal diffusivity tests. Rectangular-shaped sample


bars with the dimension of 2  mm (width) 9 8 .  
mm (length) were cut from amorphous 12 -  min


PLLA sheets, and then stretched uniaxially at 6  C using an Instron 5967 universal material testing


machine at a stretching rate of 2  mm/min. The


tensile strain was controlled to be  .5, 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
The stretched bars designated as 6 -2 -Y, in which


Y stands for the tensile strain, were measured by 2D 
wide angel X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to determine


the degree orientation. Both the through-plane and


in-plane thermal diffusivities of the stretched bars


were tested.


Characterization


WAXD measurements and data analysis


WAXD measurement of PLLA compression sheets


isothermally crystallized at 12  C for different min-


utes was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffrac-


tometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k =  .154 nm,


4  kV, 25 mA) in the scanning range of 2h = 5–6  at a scan speed of 1 /min at room temperature. The


crystallinity was determined from the fractional area


of the crystalline peaks to the total area [46].


WAXD measurement of PLLA samples stretched to


different strains at 6  C with the speed of 2  mm/


min was carried out on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER 2D 
X-ray diffractometer with the reflection mode. The


X-ray was generated using ImS micro Focus X-ray


source generator with Cu target (k =  .154 nm, 4  kV,


4  mA). The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns were


recorded on a VANTEC-5   detector system with a


pixel size of 68 9 68 mm2. The distance from the


sample to detector was 198 mm. The spot size of the


beam was  .5 mm.


Density measurement


The density of PLLA compression-molded samples


with different crystallinity was measured by using


MH-12 E density meter according to Archimedes


principle.


Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement


The empty pan, sapphire standard and PLLA com-


pression-molded samples with different crystallinity


were measured by DSC (Q2 , TA company). Samples


were measured from - 8  to 9  C with heating rate


of 1  C/min under nitrogen gas flow of 5  mL/min.


Thermal conductivity measurement by laser flash method


The sample preparation processes for the thermal


diffusivity measurements are outlined in Fig. S1. 
Before testing, the thickness and length or diameter

of the samples were measured, and then both sur-


faces of the samples were evenly sprayed with a thin


graphite layer. The sample was then fixed according


to the required test pattern and placed in the test


chamber (LFA 467, Netzsch). PLLA compression-


molded samples with different crystallinity were


tested in the temperature ranging from - 7  to 8  C, while the PLLA stretched samples with different


degree of orientation were tested at 25 C.


Results and discussion


Effect of temperature and crystallinity on the thermal conductivity of PLLA


WAXD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sam-


ples isothermally crystallized at 12  C for different


period of time are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that


the quenched PLLA compression-molded sample


without isothermal crystallization (12 -  min) shows


only a very broad diffraction peak of amorphous


phase without any traces of crystalline peaks, clearly


showing the amorphous nature of the sample owing


to the extremely slow crystallization kinetics of


PLLA. After isothermal crystallizing at 12  C, the WAXD profile of the isothermally crystallized PLLA


samples shows three peaks at 2h = 16.7, 19.  and


22.3, respectively, corresponding to the diffraction


peaks of (2  )/(11 ), (2 3) and ( 15) planes of a crystalline structure of PLLA. The diffraction inten-


sity of the peaks increases with the extension of


isothermal crystallization time, showing that


isothermal treatment at 12  C can effectively pro-


mote the crystallization of PLLA. By Gauss fitting of


the WAXD profiles, the crystallinity of all the samples


was calculated and is listed in Table 1. The results


demonstrate that the crystallinity of PLLA isother-


mally crystallized at 12  C increases with the


extension of isothermal crystallizing time, and can


even reach up to a level higher than 5 %.


The different crystallinity of PLLA samples leads to


the differences of densities, which are listed in


Table 2. It can be seen that although the crystallinity


varies in a great range after crystallizing at 12  C for


different time, the change in density, showing a slight


increasing trends, is quite limited. However, when


the crystallinity increases, the ratio of the ordered


molecular chains in the system increases, leading to


the decrease in the volume of the sample. That is why


the density of PLLA increases a little with the


increasing of crystallinity.


The specific heat (Cp) was obtained by DSC Q2  
(TA Instruments, America) at a heating rate of 1  C/ min. The Cp values of PLLA compression samples


with different crystallinity are calculated by Eq. (1):


Cp ¼ Cp m  h= mHð Þ ð1Þ 
where Cp and Cp , m and m , h and H are the specific


heat, the weight and the heat flow of PLLA sample


and sapphire standard, respectively. The specific heat


of sapphire standard is given in the DSC software.


The calculated specific heat of PLLA samples is


shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the specific heat


increases linearly before 5  C. An abrupt increase in


the specific heat is observed in the glass transition


temperature range (5 –7  C), resulting from the


change of free volume of PLLA [47], and then specific


heat remains constant for the samples with given


crystallinity after Tg. Thermal diffusivities of PLLA


samples with different crystallinity were measured


by laser flash method, which is a non-contact tran-


sient thermal measurement method widely used for


measuring the thermal diffusivity (a). With all these


parameters, the thermal conductivity of the samples


can be derived through Eq. (2):


k ¼ a q Cp ð2Þ 
where q is the bulk density and Cp is the specific heat


at a given pressure.


The thermal diffusivity and the thermal conduc-


tivity of PLLA samples with different crystallinity are Figure 1 XRD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sheets


isothermally crystallized at 12  C for different time.

shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows that the thermal


diffusivity of PLLA samples with different crys-


tallinity reduces moderately due to the decrease in


the phonon mean free path when the temperature


rises, but drops abruptly within the glass transition


temperature range. Taking 12 -4  as an example, the


thermal diffusivity decreases by  . 33 mm2/s from


- 7  to 6  C, but decreases by  . 17 mm2/s sharply


only from 6  to 8  C. The sudden drop can be


explained in terms of molecular mobility [48]. But it


should be noted that the abrupt drop trend around Tg


becomes gentler with increasing crystallinity of PLLA


samples. It can be understood from the fact that the


crystallized fractions refine the amorphous phase of


PLLA to a certain degree and hinder the molecular


motion in amorphous regions which will reduce the


phonon mean free path, especially at temperatures


near the glass transition.


Figure 3b shows the relationship between thermal


conductivity of PLLA samples with different crys-


tallinity and temperature. It can be found that the


environmental temperature affects the thermal con-


ductivity obviously. Notably, the glass transition


temperature exerts a great influence on the thermal


conductivity. In the glass state below Tg, thermal


conductivities of all the PLLA samples with different


crystallinity increase with temperature. In this tem-


perature range, two mechanisms with opposite


effects operate [48]. The thermal diffusivity decreases


with temperature increasing, while the increase in

specific heat attributes more to the thermal conduc-


tivity. The net effect is a smooth and moderate


increase in thermal conductivity with temperature


increasing. When the temperature is further


increased, the amorphous phase of PLLA sample gets


into rubbery state, and the molecular chains of the


amorphous phase begin to move, leading to a great


reduction in the phonon mean free path. So, the


thermal conductivity decreases remarkably. Such a


process produces the maximum of the thermal con-


ductivity near the glass transition temperature in the


range of the measured temperatures. Meanwhile, it


also can be seen that the thermal conductivity of


PLLA samples increases with the increase in crys-


tallinity of PLLA.


To further analyze the effect of the crystallinity on


the thermally conductive properties of PLLA, the


thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal con-


ductivity of PLLA samples at different temperatures


are presented as a function of crystallinity in Fig. 4. 
The specific heat changes linearly with the increase in


crystallinity of PLLA at different temperatures. The


slope of the fitting curve decreases from  .118 to


-  .46 with increasing temperature. It shows that the


specific heat of PLLA decreases with increasing


crystallinity when the temperature is higher than Tg,


due to that Cp for amorphous phase is larger than


crystal phase [49]. However, specific heat of PLLA


samples increases slowly with the increasing crys-


tallinity at temperatures below Tg. Thermal diffusiv-


ity of PLLA increases linearly with increasing


crystallinity, and the increasing rate keeps stable at


the temperatures below Tg, while the increasing rate


increases after Tg. When the amorphous phase is in


the rubber state, the motion of the molecular chains


reduces the phonon mean free path obviously, while


with the increasing crystallinity, the mean free path


increases distinctly. That is why the thermal diffu-


sivity increases obviously with increasing crys-


tallinity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of PLLA


samples as a result of the specific heat and thermal


diffusivity increases with increasing crystallinity.

at given temperatures.


1 548 J Mater Sci (2 18) 53:1 543–1 553 
Though the specific heat decreases with increasing


crystallinity after Tg, the thermal diffusivity com-


pensates more for the thermal conductivity. The


increase in thermal conductivity of PLLA samples


with increasing crystallinity is in agreement with that


of other semi-crystallized polymers. However, it


should be noted that TC of PLLA is not significantly


increased with crystallinity. TC of PLLA with the


crystallinity of 56% (12 -4 ) is  .196 W/mK at 2  C, only  . 25 W/mK larger than the thermal conduc-


tivity of amorphous PLLA (12 - ).


Effect of molecular orientation on the thermal conductivity of PLLA


To obtain PLLA with different degrees of orientation


and to exclude the influence of crystallization,


amorphous PLLA rectangle samples (12 -  min)


were stretched to different strains uniaxially at 6  C with the stretching rate of 2  mm/min. Different


positions were marked on the original bars. It is


found in Fig. S2(a) that the strain of every marked


length is consistent, which provides us proof for our


assumption that the orientation of different positions


on the tensile bar is similar. Taking 6 -2 -4 as an


example, 2D WAXD patterns of different positions on


the tensile bar are shown in Fig. S2(b) to verify the


degree of orientation. It shows that WAXD diffrac-


tions of the three different positions are almost the


same on the meridian and the isotropic scattering


halo develops into the two arcs along the meridian.


From the azimuth scan curve, it can be seen that the


curves of the ‘‘upper, middle, down’’ parts are basi-


cally also the same. These results indicate that


degrees of orientation of different positions along


drawing direction of the tensile bar are the same, and


the differences are negligible. This facilitates subse-


quent preparation of specimens for tests of in-plane


thermal diffusivity.


The middle part of PLLA bars stretched to different


strains is chosen to measure the degrees of orienta-


tion by 2D WAXD. The 2D WAXD patterns are


shown in Fig. 5. The un-stretched PLLA shows reg-


ular concentric rings, indicating that the initial PLLA


bar is amorphous and isotropic. With the increase in


tensile strain, the isotropic halo gradually concen-


trates to the meridian, which indicates that amor-


phous chains of PLLA samples get orientated


gradually along the drawing direction, and the


strength increases gradually. In this process, no


obvious crystal diffraction occurs. The meridian


intensity profiles extracted from the WAXD patterns


in Fig. 5b also show a very broad scattering peak of


amorphous phase without any traces of crystalline


phases. These results clearly demonstrated that the


stretched PLLA bars with different strains are all


amorphous and a series of PLLA with different


degrees of orientation have been achieved to further


reveal the influence of orientation on the thermal


conductivity of PLLA.


Both the in-plane and through-plane thermal dif-


fusivity of the stretched and un-stretched PLLA


samples were measured at 25 C. The thermal


Figure 5 2D WAXD patterns (a) of PLLA samples stretched to different strains at 6  C with the speed of 2  mm/min and meridian


intensity profiles (b) extracted from the WAXD patterns.

conductivities are calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the


specific heat and the density are constant, which are


the values of the aforementioned PLLA 12 -  min


(specific heat: 1.195 J/g K, density: 1.243 g/cm3). The


results are shown in Fig. 6. The relation between


thermal diffusivity in the in-plane direction and


tensile strain is opposite to the relation between


thermal diffusivity in the through-plane direction


and tensile strain. The thermal diffusivity in the in-


plane direction increases as the tensile strain increa-


ses, while the thermal diffusivity of PLLA samples in


the through-plane direction decreases with the


increase in tensile strain. This is owing to that the


thermal energy transports more efficiently parallel to


the tensile direction, i.e., along the polymer chain,


which consists of the strong covalent bonds, than


perpendicular to the polymer chain, where the ther-


mal energy is carried by the means of weak van der


Waals interaction of molecules [22]. That is to say, the


phonon mean free path along the tensile direction (in-


plane direction) is larger than that perpendicular to


the tensile direction (through-plane direction).


Therefore, with the increase in orientation, the ther-


mal diffusivity in the in-plane direction increases,


while the one in the through-plane direction decrea-


ses. As the specific heat and density are constant, the


variation of thermal conductivity (k) with the degree


of orientation is consistent with the variation of the


thermal diffusivity with the degree of orientation.


The thermal conductivity in the in-plane direction


(k//) increases linearly with the increase in tensile


strain, and thermal conductivity in the through-plane


direction (k\) decreases linearly with the increase in


tensile strain. When the tensile strain is 4, the TC in


the in-plane direction of PLLA is  .348 W/mK, while


the TC in the through-plane direction decreases to


 .125 W/mK. The relative thermal conductivities (k/


k )-strain data are also given in Fig. 7, showing that


the relative in-plane thermal conductivity (k///k ) is


low, only around 2 when tensile strain reaches to 4. 
Such a linear relationship between k (k// and k\) and


strain and low relative in-plane thermal conductivity


have also been observed previously for other amor-


phous polymers such as PS, PMMA, PC, etc. [3 , 32].

A specific prediction of relationship between the


conductivity of the oriented material and unoriented


material has been given as Eq. (3).

þ ð2=k?Þ ð3Þ 
TC in the directions parallel and perpendicular to


tensile direction would be principal conductivities


which would indeed bear the relationship of Eq. (3) 
to a neutral plane conductivity in uniaxially oriented


polymer. However, there is no fundamental reason


why this neutral plane conductivity is the same as the


conductivity of an unoriented specimen [32]. The


corresponding parameters in Eq. 3 of PLLA are listed


in Table 3. It is found that the thermal conductivities


of the oriented and unoriented PLLA conform with


the relationship of Eq. 3. 
Conclusion


In this work, different crystallinity and degree of


orientation of PLLA were fabricated by isothermal


crystallization at 12  C for different minutes and


stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 6  C at the


same speed to different strains, respectively. We have


demonstrated the effect of temperature, crystallinity


and degree of orientation on the thermal conductivity


of bulk PLLA samples. The thermal conductivity of


PLLA with different crystallinity was affected obvi-


ously by temperature. Before Tg, the thermal con-


ductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity


increases with temperature, mainly resulting from


the increasing specific heat. As the temperature is


further increased to be higher than Tg, the thermal


conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity


decreases remarkably due to the obvious drop of


thermal diffusivity. It demonstrates that thermal


conductivity of PLLA increases with the increase in


crystallinity, but the increasing rate is quite limited.


With orientation, the conductivity was increased in


the direction of molecular orientation and decreased


in the perpendicular direction. The reciprocal of the


two thermal conductivities in different directions of


PLLA stretched to different strains fit a linear


relationship.
