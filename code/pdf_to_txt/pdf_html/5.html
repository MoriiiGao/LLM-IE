<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Three types of low-density polyethylene materials were investigated with
respect to the influence of the molecular architecture on the mechanical and use
properties of blown films. The materials were a branched polyethylene synthesized by
free-radical polymerization under high-pressure (HP-LDPE), a linear ethylene&#8211;hexene
copolymer (ZN-LLDPE) produced by low-pressure Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysis, and an
ethylene&#8211;hexene copolymer (M-LLDPE) from metallocene catalysis. The extrusion and
blowing conditions were identical for the three materials, with a take-up ratio of 12 and
a blow-up ratio of 2.5. The blown films displayed a decreasing puncture resistance in
the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and HP-LDPE. In parallel, the tear resistance of the
films became increasingly unbalanced in the same order of the polymers. The morpho-
logical study showed an increased anisotropy of the films in the same polymer order, the
crystalline lamellae being increasingly oriented normal to the take-up direction. This
texturing caused a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the films, notably
increasing the capacity for crack propagation. The phenomenon was ascribed to the
kinetics of chain relaxation in the melt that governed the ability of the chains to recover
an isotropic state from the flow-induced stretching before crystallization. The puncture
resistance was examined in terms of both texture and strain-hardening capabilities.

<p><b>INTRODUCTION
</b></p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, ethylene/&#1;-olefin copoly-
mers synthesized by Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysis have
been largely developed in the domain of blown
films for packaging applications, in concurrence
with low-density polyethylenes (PEs) produced by
high-pressure free-radical polymerization. In re-
</p>
<p>cent years, copolymers issued from metallocene
technology have taken an increasing place in the
field of film blowing because of excellent optical
properties combined with remarkable mechanical
performances.1 For the processing difficulties of
metallocene copolymers due to narrow molar
weight distributions (MWDs), technical solutions
have been found by either the incorporation of
very low amounts of long side chains or the pro-
duction of bimodal MWDs.2,3 There is, however,
much work left to do to understand the property
upgrade of such novel materials, notably for film
applications.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The influence of molecular orientation on the
use properties of PE blown films has stimulated
profuse studies on the processing&#8211;structure and
processing&#8211;property relationships.4&#8211;31 Neverthe-
less, little has been accomplished in terms of un-
derstanding the influence of the molecular archi-
tecture on the structure and mechanical proper-
ties of films, via processing conditions. This study
focused on three types of low-density PE issued
from three different types of polymerization tech-
niques. The differences in the use properties of
the blown films were analyzed through the crys-
talline texture under similar processing condi-
tions for the various polymers.
</p>
<p><b>EXPERIMENTAL
</b></p>
<p>Three low-density PE materials from various
sources were studied. The molecular and physical
characteristics of the materials are shown in Ta-
ble 1. M-LLDPE and ZN-LLDPE were linear eth-
ylene&#8211;hexene copolymers synthesized by metal-
locene and Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, respectively.
The former one, with a narrower MWD, was sus-
pected to contain a few long side chains on the
basis of elongational viscosity. HP-LDPE was is-
sued from the high-pressure free-radical polymer-
ization of ethylene in an autoclave. It contained
long-chain branches (LCBs) and short-chain
branches (SCBs) mainly composed of butyl side
groups with minor amounts of ethyl side
groups.32
</p>
<p>Tubular blown films, about 50 &#2;m thick, were
processed with an annular die extruder with a
15-cm diameter and a 1.5-mm gap. For the sake of
comparison of the blown-film properties, the pro-
cessing conditions were kept as close as possible
for the three materials: flow rate &#1; 40 kg/h, melt
temperature at the die &#1; 190 &#176;C, frost-line height
&#1; 50 cm, take-up speed &#1; 12 m/min, take-up ratio
(TUR) &#1;12 in the so-called machine direction
(MD), and blow-up ratio (BUR) &#1; 2.5 in the trans-
</p>
<p>verse direction (TD). These conditions corre-
sponded to the optimum blowing capabilities of
HP-LDPE. The direction perpendicular to the film
surface was defined as the normal direction (ND).
</p>
<p>For the evaluation of the intrinsic properties of
the materials, 1-mm-thick isotropic sheets were
also prepared. Pellets were compression-molded
for 5 min at 180 &#176;C and subsequently crystallized
by being cooled to room temperature (RT) at
about 20 &#176;C/min.
</p>
<p>The relaxation time, &#3;, of the materials in the
melt was determined from viscoelastic measure-
ments at 190 &#176;C with a Rheometric RSA II appa-
ratus in the cone&#8211;plane configuration. The assess-
ment of &#3; was made from the Cole&#8211;Cole diagram
of the loss shear modulus versus the storage
shear modulus.
</p>
<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) mea-
surements were performed on a PerkinElmer
DSC-7 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 &#176;C/min.
The calibration of the temperature scale was
achieved from the melting scans of high-purity
indium and zinc samples at the same heating
rate. The melting point (<i>T</i>f) of the materials was
determined at the peak of the melting endotherm
of the heating scan following standard cooling
from the melt at 10 &#176;C/min.
</p>
<p>Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used
to investigate the crystalline lamellar morphology
and texture of the films. The X-ray beam was
provided by a Rigaku Cu rotating anode having a
0.1 mm focus and operated at 30 kV and 40 mA.
An assembly of two Ni-coated curved mirrors at a
right angle was used for a punctual collimation of
the incident beam. The scattered intensity was
detected with a position-sensitive linear counter
selecting Cu K&#1; X-ray photons. It was located at
80 cm of the sample, with a vacuum section be-
tween the detector and sample. For optimum X-
ray absorption, approximately 2-mm-thick sam-
ples were made by several pieces of films or com-
pression-molded sheets being piled up. For blown
films, the through-view scattering curves were

scattering curves were also recorded parallel to
MD and ND. For a comparison of the scattering
intensity profiles versus the scattering vector of
the various materials, all the intensity data in
arbitrary units were corrected for the background
scattering, absorption, and Lorentz factor.33 The
transmission coefficient for every sample was de-
termined from the ratio of the peak intensities of
the incident beam with and without the sample.
The intercrystalline long period, <i>L</i>, was directly
determined from the correlation peak of the in-
tensity profile. The average crystal thickness, <i>L</i>c,
was assessed from the equation <i>L</i>c &#2; <i>L</i>&#4;c, which
assumes much greater length and width of the
crystalline lamellae than their thickness. The
crystal volume fraction, &#4;c, was computed from
the density, &#5;, of the material with the relation &#4;c
</p>
<p>&#2; (&#5; &#3; &#5;a)/(&#5;c &#3; &#5;a), where &#5;c &#2; 1.000 g/cm3 and &#5;a
</p>
<p>&#2; 0.855 g/cm are the densities of perfectly crys-
talline orthorhombic PE and amorphous PE, re-
spectively.34
</p>
<p>Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experi-
ments were performed in the transmission mode
with monochromatic Cu K&#1; radiation. Through-
view patterns on films were recorded on a two-
dimensional CCD camera.
</p>
<p>The tear and puncture resistance of the blown
films were determined at RT according to the
standard Elmendorf test (ASTM D 1922) and dart
impact test (ASTM D 1709), respectively. Conven-
tional tensile stress&#8211;strain measurements were
carried out at RT on an Instron testing machine
at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min, with dumb-
bell samples 100 mm in gauge length. Both iso-
tropic sheets and films were tested. For films,
tensile experiments were carried out along MD
and TD. The reported curves are representative of
three different measurements.
</p>
<p>Shrinkage measurements of the blown films
above <i>T</i>f were carried out with 5 cm &#4; 5 cm
specimens suspended by small clamps into an
oven at 130 &#176;C for 5 min. Shrinkage data along
MD and TD were assessed from the ratio of the
dimension change to the initial dimension of the
film piece. Experiments at various temperatures
between 125 and 135 &#176;C showed some tempera-
ture dependence of the M-LLDPE shrinkage,
whereas ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE proved to be
almost insensitive. However, the ranking of the
materials in terms of shrinkage capacity did not
depend on temperature.
</p>
<p><b>TEAR AND PUNCTURE RESISTANCE OF
THE FILMS
</b></p>
<p>An examination of the dart impact data of films in
Table 2 shows that HP-LDPE has the lowest
puncture resistance of the three materials. More-
over, the perforation of HP-LDPE films appears
as an elongated crack parallel to TD. In contrast,
ZN-LLDPE exhibits an elongated perforation par-
allel to MD. M-LLDPE displays the best film
puncture resistance, and the perforation is fairly
circular. These observations are relevant to the
structural anisotropy of both HP-LDPE and ZN-
LLDPE, whereas M-LLDPE looks rather iso-
tropic.
</p>
<p>Under tear testing, HP-LDPE displays the low-
est capabilities of the three materials. It is nota-
bly unbalanced, with a higher tear resistance in
MD. The better tear performances of M-LLDPE
are fairly well equilibrated along MD and TD.
M-LLDPE is challenged by ZN-LLDPE with re-
spect to the level of tear resistance, even though
the latter displays nonequilibrated properties,
the higher tear resistance being in TD.
</p>
<p>In summary, the puncture and tear properties
of M-LLDPE are fairly high and isotropic despite
the largely unbalanced TUR and BUR of the
films. In contrast, HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE re-
veal strong anisotropy along TD and MD that
suggests chain orientation and/or crystalline tex-
turing of the films. The anisotropy effect is, how-
ever, opposite in the two materials, despite iden-
tical blowing conditions: ZN-LLDPE is more tear-
resistant in TD than in MD, whereas HP-LDPE
displays greater tear resistance in MD. Similar
observations of opposite behavior between linear
PE films11,15,23,24,30 and branched PE films20,28
</p>
<p>can be found in the literature for usual blowing
conditions notably involving TUR &#5; BUR. This
surprising finding suggests that the intuitive pic-
ture of an improved tear resistance normal to the

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>main-chain orientation of the films, which is MD
in most cases, does work for ZN-LLDPE but does
not work for HP-LDPE. Otherwise, it was pro-
posed by Kim and coworkers23,24 and Andre et
al.29 that crystalline lamellar orientation might
be more important than the molecular orientation
with respect to tear resistance because lamellae
are likely to act as obstacles to crack propagation.
This is the reason for the following structural
study.
</p>
<p><b>STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE
</b></p>
<p><b>Compression-Molded Sheets
</b></p>
<p>For the three kinds of PE studied, the SAXS data
of Table 3 reveal very similar if not equal crystal
thicknesses for isotropic sheets and films. This is
relevant to the relatively low sensitivity of low-
density PE materials to the cooling rate, that is,
about 20&#176;/s for blown films and 20&#176;/min for com-
pression-molded sheets.
</p>
<p>Considering the densities of the materials under
investigation and using the data from Kuhn and
Kro&#776;mer,32 we can assume a butyl SCB rate of about
17/1000 C (where C is a carbon atom of the polymer
backbone) for HP-LDPE, whereas a rough figure of
18/1000 C can be assumed for the butyl SCB con-
centration of both ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE ac-
cording to various literature data.23,35,36 Under
such considerations, it turns out that the average
distance between short branches along the main
chain is about 7 nm. The quite good consistency of
this figure with the crystal thickness of the materi-
als reported in Table 3 supports the largely ac-
cepted scheme of an exclusion from the crystalline
phase of the SCB having two carbon atoms or more.
As a matter of fact, if the SCB bulkiness prevents
the counit inclusion in the crystal lattice due to
crystal growth, one should expect <i>L</i>c to be governed
</p>
<p>by the average length of the crystallizable methyl-
ene sequences.37
</p>
<p>M-LLDPE and HP-LDPE have somewhat
lower <i>L</i>c values (Table 3) than ZN-LLDPE, with
a concomitant lower <i>T</i>f. This is relevant to the
more uniform distribution of the counits or
SCBs of the former two materials. Heteroge-
neous ZN copolymers are indeed well known to
grow thicker crystals with higher <i>T</i>f values than
homogeneous copolymers or branched PEs of
similar crystallinity38 &#8211; 40 because of almost
counit-free chains. This is an advantage for
some applications such as hot tack but is prej-
udicial for optical properties, for instance.38
</p>
<p>This structural difference should nonetheless
have very little impact on tear and puncture
properties, notably on anisotropy.
</p>
<p><b>Blown Films
</b></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the through-view SAXS profiles
from the films of the three materials recorded
parallel to MD and TD. The nearly identical in-
tensity profiles of Figure 1(c) indicate a fairly
isotropic structure for M-LLDPE in the plane of
the film, which contrasts with the strong anisot-
ropy of the HP-LDPE film revealed in Figure 1(a).
Not only is the SAXS correlation peak much
higher along MD than along TD for HP-LDPE,
but the peak intensities are respectively greater
and smaller than those of the M-LLDPE SAXS
peak. This anisotropy of HP-LDPE is relevant to
the well-known flow-induced row texture of blown
films and spun fibers41 with the crystalline lamel-
lae essentially normal to MD. The ZN-LLDPE
film displays an intermediate state of orientation
[Fig. 1(b)] between HP-LDPE and M-LLDPE
films [Fig. 1(a,c)], the crystalline lamellae being
still preferentially normal to MD.
</p>
<p>SAXS measurements from the edges of the
films corroborate the row texture of the HP-LDPE

the edge-view profile recorded along MD shows a
much stronger intensity maximum than the one
</p>
<p>along ND. This is clear evidence that most of the
crystalline lamellae lie normal to MD. It is quite
surprising that M-LLDPE also displays some an-
isotropy from the edge view of the film [Fig. 2(b)],
which suggests that the elongated crystalline la-
mellae, otherwise lamellar ribbons, have a pre-
dominant orientation along ND. Considering the
through-view isotropy of M-LLDPE [Fig. 1(c)], we
may ascribe this finding to a preferred orientation
of the growth direction of the lamellar ribbons,
namely, the crystallographic <i>b </i>axis,42 along the
temperature gradient43,44 during the crystalliza-
tion step, that is, the film thickness in this in-
stance. This effect should also exist for HP-LDPE
but is certainly hidden by the flow-induced row
texture. The M-LLDPE film may, therefore, be
called orthotropic rather than isotropic.

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The WAXS patterns of Figure 3 show a rein-
forcement of the inner (110) and outer (200) re-
flections in the MD and TD positions, respec-
tively, for HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films. This is
relevant to the so-called low-stress row structure
of Keller and Machin,41 which corresponds to a
preferred orientation of the twisted crystalline
lamellae with the crystallographic <i>b </i>axis, that is,
the growth axis, roughly parallel to TD, and the <i>a
</i>and <i>c </i>axes being randomly distributed about TD
because of the lamellar twisting. The diagonal
reinforcement of the (110) reflection for the HP-
LDPE film [Fig. 3(a)] reveals a sharper orienta-
tion of the <i>b </i>axis parallel to TD than for ZN-
LLDPE. The M-LLDPE film displays no preferred
orientation of the crystalline phase in the film,
indicating isotropy or orthotropy. These WAXS
data corroborate the conclusions from SAXS.
</p>
<p>With respect to the compression-molded
sheets, the unreported WAXS patterns confirm
the completely isotropic structure for the three
materials.
</p>
<p><b>UNIAXIAL TENSILE DRAWING
</b></p>
<p><b>Compression-Molded Sheets
</b></p>
<p>In conjunction with structural investigations,
several authors have used uniaxial tensile draw-
ing of blown films to understand the tear and
puncture behavior.10,20,24,30,31 Because the dart
test is equivalent to a multiaxial tensile test, it is
obvious that uniaxial testing at various orienta-
tions with respect to MD may be valuable for
understanding the puncture resistance of films.
In contrast, tensile drawing does not seem to have
significant relevance to tear resistance, at first
sight. Nevertheless, it clearly appears from the
literature data24,30 that the more unbalanced the
tear resistance is in MD and TD of blown films,
the greater the departure is of both the strain
hardening and the elongation at break of the films
upon tensile drawing along MD and TD.
</p>
<p>The engineering stress&#8211;strain curves of the iso-
tropic compression-molded polymers are reported
in Figure 4. The three materials have about the
same yield stress at 10 &#6; 1 MPa. However, HP-
LDPE displays a lower elongation at rupture and
a lower strain hardening than ZN-LLDPE. This
well-known phenomenon can be ascribed to the
bulkiness of the branched molecules with LCBs,
which limit chain overlapping in the melt. A re-

<p><b>332 </b>GUICHON ET AL.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>sult of this phenomenon is to reduce the entan-
glement density and the intercrystalline tie chain
frequency in the crystallized material.38 This
point is more specifically addressed in the Discus-
sion section.
</p>
<p>M-LLDPE displays a lower elongation at break
than ZN-LLDPE but exhibits a surprisingly
higher strain hardening. A similar observation in
a previous study40 has been ascribed to a higher
concentration of entanglements and tie chains in
M-LLDPE because of the homogeneous distribu-
tions of the counits, which not only reduces crys-
tal thickness in comparison with ZN-LLDPE (see
the previous section) but also reduces the pro-
cesses of regular folding and reeling-induced dis-
entanglement of the chains during crystalliza-
tion. Therefore, in contrast to HP-LDPE, which is
less resistant to tensile drawing than ZN-LLDPE
because of lower overlapping of the chains, M-
LLDPE looks significantly more resistant than
ZN-LLDPE because of better chain intertwining.
</p>
<p><b>Blown Films
</b></p>
<p>Figure 5 shows the tensile stress&#8211;strain curves
along MD and TD for the three types of films.
M-LLDPE displays quite similar behavior when
tested along MD and TD [Fig. 5(c)]. Besides, the
stress&#8211;strain curves resemble that of the isotropic
compression-molded sheet (Fig. 4), notably with
respect to extension at break and strain harden-
ing. This finding means that M-LLDPE is almost
isotropic and accounts for the well-equilibrated
</p>
<p>TD and MD tear resistance. In contrast, HP-
LDPE and ZN-LLDPE films exhibit unbalanced
tensile properties along MD and TD [Fig. 5(a,b)],

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>notably a lower drawability along MD. Besides,
drawability in both directions is lower than that
of the compression-molded sheets, this phenome-
non being much more pronounced for HP-LDPE.
This means that both ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display a higher degree of chain extension in MD.
In parallel to its much reduced drawability in
MD, HP-LDPE displays a surprising jump of the
yield stress to about 15 MPa in MD, in contrast to
10 MPa in TD and for the isotropic sheet. This point
is specifically addressed in the Discussion section.
</p>
<p>The nearly isotropic properties of the M-
LLDPE film suggest that the chains have an al-
most undisturbed coil conformation despite the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. In contrast,
the unbalanced properties of ZN-LLDPE and HP-
LDPE films, together with the significant loss of
drawability with respect to their isotropic com-
pression-molded counterparts, are relevant to a
significant chain extension in the films. This is
evidence that the flow-induced extension of the
chains during the blowing process has been partly
frozen-in during the solidification step, for both
HP-LDPE and ZN-LLDPE. This suggests that
these two materials have less capacity for chain
relaxation in the melt than M-LLDPE, HP-LDPE
being the most quenching-sensitive.
</p>
<p>The strain hardening of M-LLDPE, both in
films and sheets, is somewhat higher than that of
the two other materials. Such a property notably
reduces the capacity for plastic instabilities dur-
ing deformation and, therefore, contributes to the
improvement of the puncture resistance of the
M-LLDPE film. As a corollary to its higher strain
hardening, the M-LLDPE film exhibits lower
standard deviations of the tear and puncture re-
sistance data (Table 2) that are relevant to a
weaker sensitivity to structural film defects such
as thickness fluctuations and inclusions.
</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION
</b></p>
<p>Table 4 reports a summary of the film properties.
Both structural and mechanical anisotropy in-
crease in the order M-LLDPE, ZN-LLDPE, and
HP-LDPE. In comparison with the compression-
molded sheets, the tensile drawing of the films
clearly reveals that, despite the similar blowing
conditions, the three materials have different lev-
els of chain extension (otherwise chain unfolding)
depending on the chain architecture. The shrink-
age data of Table 4, which reflect the degree of
chain extension frozen in the films, thoroughly
support this conclusion. The material rankings
for the degree of chain extension of the films are
the same as the previous ones for the increasing
anisotropy. The different levels of chain extension
of the three materials, superimposed on the crys-
talline texturing, can be analyzed with regard to
the rheological properties of the materials, in re-
lation to the processing conditions.
</p>
<p><b>Chain Relaxation during Blowing
</b></p>
<p>The mean relaxation time data of Table 1 show
that the three materials have quite different ca-
pabilities of relaxation in the melt of the flow-
induced chain extension accompanying TUR &#1; 12
and BUR &#1; 2.5. Considering the frost-line height
of about 50 cm and the take-up speed of 12 m/min
used in the blowing process, one may estimate
that the molten material experiences an exten-
sional flow for about 2.5 s before solidification.
The actual duration of the extensional flow is
certainly shorter than this figure because the
chain-extension pathway along TD and MD is not
uniform over the whole length between the die
and the frost line. Therefore, it is clear that the
relaxation time of HP-LDPE may hardly allow a

ing the time that elapses between extrusion and
crystallization. In contrast, ZN-LLDPE and M-
LLDPE are clearly capable of relaxing the flow-
induced chain extension, at least in part, before
crystallization.
</p>
<p>Ghaneh-Fard et al.45 pointed out the role of
chain relaxation on the orientational behavior of
blown films in the melt before crystallization. Yu
and Wilkes22 emphasized the drastic effect of long
chains having a long relaxation time on film ori-
entation. Lu et al.30,31 demonstrated that the
shape of the incipient bubble, which is governed
by the cooling conditions, strongly influences the
film texture and properties because of the modi-
fications of the relaxation capabilities of the mol-
ten material along MD and TD. Prasad et al.46
</p>
<p>also reported recently that LCBs in linear HDPE
induce a strong texturing of blown films because
of a drastic increase of the longest relaxation time
in the melt. In contrast, Plumbey et al.20 reported
a nearly isotropic structure for metallocene copol-
ymer films, despite unbalanced TUR and BUR
values. Recently, Legros et al.26 reported that
metallocene copolymers afford significantly less
oriented films than corresponding Ziegler&#8211;Natta
copolymers. These observations, which corrobo-
rate our own findings on the M-LLDPE film, can
unambiguously be ascribed to the rather short
relaxation time of metallocene copolymers, which
is due to the narrow MWD.
</p>
<p>With respect to the shrinkage behavior, the
data reported in the last column of Table 4 show
that the three kinds of films systematically shrink
more along MD than along TD. However, these
data also display quite different shrinkage capa-
bilities of the films in the order HP-LDPE &#5; ZN-
LLDPE &#5; M-LLDPE. The very low shrinkage of
the M-LLDPE film is notably indicative of a very
faint chain extension. This finding thoroughly
agrees with the MD and TD tensile drawing be-
havior of the M-LLDPE film, which closely resem-
bles that of the compression-molded sheet. There-
fore, the so-called orthotropy of the M-LLDPE
film, which has been concluded from the stand-
point of texture, turns out to be very close to
isotropy from a mechanical standpoint.
</p>
<p>ZN-LLDPE is slightly unbalanced with respect
to the stress&#8211;strain curves in TD and MD [Fig.
5(b)], and the curves are not so far from the one of
the isotropic sheet (Fig. 4). In contrast, HP-LDPE
is highly unbalanced, and the stress&#8211;strain
curves reveal higher drawability along TD. Be-
</p>
<p>sides, HP-LDPE displays significantly lower
strain hardening and lower stress at break than
ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE. The strong mechani-
cal anisotropy and poor performances at rupture
provide an explanation for the relatively poor dart
impact resistance of the HP-LDPE film.
</p>
<p>The contrasting behaviors of HP-LDPE and
ZN-LLDPE with respect to tearing, that is, the
higher tear resistance being along MD and TD,
respectively, suggest a competition between crys-
tal orientation and chain extension in the process
of crack propagation, which is discussed later.
</p>
<p>The quite different degrees of texturing of the
three kinds of materials, which greatly influence
their tensile drawing behavior and use properties,
can be explained by the rheology of the materials:
the much shorter relaxation time of M-LLDPE in
the melt allows an almost complete relaxation of
the flow-extended chains toward the stable ran-
dom coil conformation, during the time elapsing
between the die and the frost line. ZN-LLDPE
and HP-LDPE are only partly able to relax the
chain extension before crystallization, the latter
having greater hindrance for chain relaxation.
</p>
<p><b>Chain Intertwining
</b></p>
<p>The entanglement of chains has a tremendous
effect on both rheological and solid state prop-
erties. It strongly contributes to the strain-
hardening effect in the elongational viscosity,
which is a basic factor of bubble stability during
tubular film blowing.47 It is also a determining
factor for the mechanical properties of blown
films via drawability and strain hardening.
However, it is noteworthy that branched and
linear PEs display a puzzling opposite behavior
with respect to this latter property: namely, the
strain hardening of melt elongational viscosity
is high for branched PEs and low for linear
PEs,47 whereas just the opposite trend is ob-
served for the solid materials.38
</p>
<p>This phenomenon emphasizes the drastic in-
fluence of molecular dynamics on chain extension
in the melt, which contrasts with the predomi-
nance of structural factors such as the entangle-
ment density on chain extension in the solid state.
Indeed, in the case of elongational flow experi-
ments,47 the strain hardening of branched PEs,
which is relevant to chain extension, can be re-
duced to about nothing if the timescale of the
experiments is comparable or greater than the
relaxation time. This is a clear indication of the
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>transient character of the chain network in the
melt, which may disentangle under extensional
flow at a low strain rate. For linear PEs, no strain
hardening of the elongational viscosity suggests a
high capacity for chain disentanglement during
extensional flow. In the solid state, chain exten-
sion is governed by the entanglement density,
which determines the strain hardening.48 The
lower strain hardening of branched PEs may be
ascribed to a low entanglement density.
</p>
<p>The ability of polymer chains for intertwining
in the melt is mainly connected to the chain flex-
ibility, which is explained by the so-called <i>C</i>&#8;
</p>
<p>parameter. Besides this parameter, the overlap-
ping capability of the chain coils of a given poly-
mer species, such as PE in this instance, is highly
sensitive to the molecular architecture of the
chains. If we neglect thermal expansion effects,
the degree of chain overlap in the melt can be
defined as the ratio
</p>
<p><i>X </i>&#7; &#5;/&#5;app (1)
</p>
<p>of the actual density of molten PE, &#5; &#1; 0.85 g/cm3,
to the apparent density of the chain coils, &#5;app.
Indeed, if we consider an isolated chain of molar
weight <i>M</i>, the <i>X </i>parameter provides an estima-
tion of the number of parent chains of the same
molar weight that must intertwine within the
volume embraced by the isolated chain in a ran-
dom coil conformation to achieve the actual den-
sity of the molten polymer. The apparent density
of the isolated chain can be estimated from the
ratio of the molar weight to the volume of the
sphere of radius equal to the radius of gyration of
the random coil, <i>R</i>g, because this sphere enfolds
more than 90% of the segments of the chain coil.49
</p>
<p>For linear PE and ethylene copolymers, one may
consider the following relationship established
from literature data:50
</p>
<p><i>R</i>g &#1; 1.26<i>M
</i>1&#8260;2 (2)
</p>
<p>where <i>R</i>g is given in nanometers and <i>M </i>is given in
kilodaltons. Now, if we consider a linear low-den-
sity polyethylene (LLDPE) chain with <i>M </i>&#2; 100
kDa, that is, about the weight-average molecular
weight (<i>M</i>w) for the polymers investigated in this
work, it turns out that <i>R</i>g is approximately 12.6
nm, and the apparent density is &#5;app &#1; 0.02 g/cm3.
Borrowing from Kuhn and Kromer&#8217;s32 study of
the molecular architecture of HP-LDPE, we have
</p>
<p>sketched Figure 6 a chain of molar weight <i>M
</i>&#2; 100 kDa of the single-autoclave HP-LDPE in a
branch-extended conformation. The HP-LDPE
molecule notably exhibits 10 LCBs with an aver-
age molar weight between LCBs close to 6 kDa.
One may estimate to about 42 kDa the molar
weight of its main chain, which is shown as a bold
line in Figure 6. Assuming, in the first approxi-
mation, that LCBs do not significantly change the
chain conformation in the melt, one may estimate
the radius of gyration of the HP-LDPE chain coil,
<i>R</i>g &#1; 8.0 nm, from the length of its main chain
with eq 2. The apparent density of the HP-LDPE
chain coil is, therefore, &#5;app &#1; 0.08 g/cm3.
</p>
<p>Despite numerous assumptions, the aforemen-
tioned apparent density data reveal that the
chains are deeply interpenetrated in the molten
materials: for a chain of molar weight <i>M </i>&#2; 100
kDa, the degree of chain overlap is <i>X </i>&#1; 50 for
LLDPE and <i>X </i>&#1; 12 for HP-LDPE. Besides, these
data show that chain overlap is much greater for
LLDPE than for HP-LDPE.
</p>
<p>This finding suggests that interchain entangle-
ments, which provide the strength of the molecu-
lar network in the melt and in the solid state, are
significantly more numerous in linear chains
than in branched chains. Indeed, reduced over-
lapping reduces the probability of neighboring
chains intertwining with each other. This has
already been claimed to be an explanation for the

tecture of an HP-LDPE branched chain with a molar

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>higher strain hardening of linear PEs in the solid
state.38 Of course, LCBs can make entanglements
among themselves, within the sphere of gyration
of the coil, but these intramolecular entangle-
ments only contribute to the coil stiffness instead
of the network strength. However, as previously
pointed out, the strain hardening in the melt is
lower for linear PEs than for branched PEs. This
phenomenon, apparently contradicting the higher
entanglement density of linear PEs, can be ex-
plained by dynamic effects during the extensional
flow in the melt,47,51 namely, a lower resistance to
either disentanglement or strain-induced orienta-
tion of linear chains in comparison with branched
chains. The longer relaxation time in the melt of
branched PEs (see Table 1) supports this proposal
of reduced chain dynamics due to LCBs.
</p>
<p><b>Chain Unfolding versus Chain and/or Lamellar
Orientation
</b></p>
<p>Several authors have recently suggested that the
orientation of lamellar stacks in blown films is
responsible for unbalanced properties,24,29&#8211;31 in
contrast with most authors, who incriminate mo-
lecular orientation. Lu et al.30,31 notably showed
that processing conditions that promote randomly
oriented lamellar stacks reduce mechanical an-
isotropy and improve dart impact resistance. Our
data on M-LLDPE thoroughly support this find-
ing. However, because ZN-LLDPE and HP-LDPE
display the same type of texture, with the lamel-
lae preferentially oriented normal to MD, the re-
verse trend of the two types of films with respect
to MD and TD tear resistance reveal that the real
situation is somewhat more complex than that
previously described. We suggest that, beyond la-
mellar and chain orientations, chain unfolding is
a factor of prime importance.
</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the unfolding of the
chains during the blowing process increases the
density of chain segments lying in the plane of the
film. If one intuitively considers that tear resis-
tance is governed by the frequency of such chain
segments that oppose themselves to the propaga-
tion of the crack, one should expect an improve-
ment of tear resistance with increasing chain ex-
tension. The drawability and shrinkage data from
Table 1 clearly show that the ZN-LLDPE film has
preferred chain extension along MD, and this
means that more chain segments will bar the way
to the crack propagation along TD in comparison
</p>
<p>with MD. This is why ZN-LLDPE has greater tear
resistance in TD than in MD.
</p>
<p>Regarding the HP-LDPE film, both drawability
and shrinkage show that there is a high degree of
chain extension along MD and moderate chain
extension along TD, the latter being significantly
higher than that for ZN-LLDPE and M-LLDPE.
An explanation for this is that the branches of the
star-shaped macromolecules are unfolded in the
two main directions during the blowing process,
and only a part of this unfolding can be relaxed
before crystallization because of the rather high
relaxation time. The chain extension that is fro-
zen in the film is greater along MD because of the
higher value of TUR with respect to BUR. In
addition, because the chains are not ideally
spherical but consist of a main chain with lateral
LCBs, as sketched in Figure 6, this main chain is
likely to preferentially unfold along MD during
the blowing process because TUR &#6; BUR and also
because of a suspected much longer relaxation
time of the main chain in comparison with that of
the LCBs. Consequently, the LCBs should act as
molecular arms, slightly extended in TD, all along
the main chain. If this is the case, a propagating
crack would cross more chain segments in MD
than in TD. This provides an explanation for the
greater tear resistance of HP-LDPE in MD than
in TD, that is, a reverse behavior of that of ZN-
LLDPE. Nevertheless, the overall higher level of
tear resistance of the latter can be explained by
the higher degree of chain overlapping of ZN-
LLDPE, which involves a higher degree of chain
entanglement and, therefore, a higher mechani-
cal strength of the macromolecular network.
</p>
<p>The fact that the M-LLDPE film is challenged
by the ZN-LLDPE film with respect to the level of
the tear resistance in both MD and TD, despite its
well-equilibrated tear behavior and better punc-
ture resistance, deserves special attention. The
explanation is straightforward in consideration of
our previous argument on the density of chain
segments that can act as obstacles to the propa-
gation of the crack during the tear test. Indeed,
the nearly isotropic M-LLDPE film necessarily
contains fewer chain segments oriented parallel
to the film plane than the ZN-LLDPE film to
make opposition to either MD or TD tear. It is,
therefore, suggested that isotropy is beneficial for
puncture resistance because of the high drawabil-
ity afforded by the chain in a random coil confor-
mation, but this is not favorable for optimum tear
resistance, despite good balance.
</p>
<p>MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE OF LDPE <b>337</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Finally, a last comment should be made re-
garding the shape of the stress&#8211;strain curve along
MD of the HP-LDPE film, the yield stress being
50% higher than that along TD, as well as that of
the isotropic material. This phenomenon has been
reported previously for branched PEs38 but never
for linear PEs. This cannot be explained solely by
the high degree of chain extension along MD. We
suspect that the strong orientation of the crystal-
line lamellae with their normal along MD, as
judged from SAXS [Fig. 1(a)], prevents the plastic
shear processes through both the sample width
and thickness of the film because the resolved
shear stress (RSS) on the (<i>hk</i>0) slip planes is nil.
Plasticity may only take place after some tilt of
the lamellae to orient the slip planes toward the
maximum RSS. Rotation about the <i>b </i>axis is by far
the most easy tilt process because of the rather
large form factor of the lamellae. However, the
high degree of chain extension along MD, already
discussed, is likely to hinder the lamellar tilting
as the applied tensile stress increases. The criti-
cal RSS in the crystalline lamellae will then be
reached after the applied tensile stress has
jumped much above the value required for yield-
ing for the corresponding isotropic sample.
</p>
<p><b>Isotropy versus Orthotropy
</b></p>
<p>ZN-LLDPE exhibits better tear resistance than
M-LLDPE, despite its anisotropy. In contrast, iso-
tropic M-LLDPE has a better puncture resistance
because of high drawability with high energy ab-
sorption. Therefore, if the chain extension that
takes place during blowing involves an increase
in the chain segment density within the film
plane that is beneficial for tear resistance, it is
quite clear that isotropy is beneficial for puncture
resistance. One may, nevertheless, wonder if or-
thotropy, involving equilibrated chain extension
along MD and TD, would not be the best way for
optimum puncture and tear resistance, with a fair
balance of the latter along MD and TD.
</p>
<p>Metallocene PEs have short relaxation times in
the melt that make them able to recover most of
the chain extension developed during the time of
the blowing before crystallization. This is the rea-
son for the fair isotropy of the films, which ac-
counts for the mechanical properties. Linear PEs
can also be blown into nearly isotropic films, but
the reasons are quite different. TUR and BUR are
generally the major factors of film texturing. The
common situation, with TUR greater than BUR,
</p>
<p>leads to the row structure with the crystalline
lamellae normal to MD. Reducing the TUR/BUR
ratio provides a means of reducing the structural
anisotropy and improving in parallel both the
puncture resistance and tear resistance bal-
ance.18,25,29&#8211;31 Unfortunately, this situation is too
far from industrial conditions of film blowing.
However, the deformation path of the molten ma-
terial during tubular blowing is strongly depen-
dant on the processing parameters, such as the
stress, air velocity, and freeze-line height. Those
parameters may be adjusted for re-equilibrating
the difference of chain extension induced by the
largely unbalanced TUR and BUR. The deforma-
tion path can notably be modified by changes in
the freeze-line height.28,30,31,52,53 Therefore, the
shape of the bubble in the deformation zone be-
tween the die and the crystallization line may
have the form of either a bowl or a stemmed
glass,52 depending on whether film stretching
along MD and TD takes place in a simultaneous
or sequential manner, respectively. This involves
a modification of the molecular extension pro-
cesses and notably enables a more important re-
laxation-induced rearrangement of the chains in
the direction in which chain extension occurred
first.30,31,53 This was the way used by Lu et al.31 to
reverse the MD-to-TD tear resistance ratio for
HDPE films for the same TUR/BUR ratio of ap-
proximately 8. Despite this high TUR/BUR ratio,
the authors showed that increasing the time al-
lowed for MD chain relaxation involved a higher
level of TD chain extension in comparison with
MD, as revealed by the MD and TD tensile draw-
ing curves.31 This resulted in an unusual greater
tear resistance for linear PE in MD than in TD.
</p>
<p>Some authors have claimed that isotropy is
favorable for film use properties.10,18,19 However,
it seems that the so-called isotropy of the films,
judged either from two-dimensional structural
studies in the plane of the film or from the com-
parison of MD and TD mechanical properties,
might be, in fact, an orthotropy. Only metallocene
PEs really display isotropy, regardless of blowing
conditions, because of relaxation times much
shorter than those for conventional linear or
branched LDPE at an equivalent melt-flow index
(MFI).
</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS
</b></p>
<p>The tear and puncture resistance of films largely
depend on the processing-induced texture. M-

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>LLDPE has a very short relaxation time in the
melt in comparison with the time that the mate-
rial remains in the molten state between the die
and the frost line. This enables the chains
stretched by the blow-up and take-up to relax to a
nearly isotropic state. This almost annihilates
film texturing and imparts better dart impact
performances in comparison with those of ZN-
LLDPE and HP-LDPE. The slightly higher strain
hardening of M-LLDPE, which is ascribed to a
very small number of LCBs, also contributes to its
high puncture resistance.
</p>
<p>The better use properties of ZN-LLDPE in com-
parison with those of HP-LDPE are assigned to
better chain intertwining and higher strain hard-
ening in the solid state. The opposite behavior of
the two materials with respect to the unbalanced
tear resistance of the films is ascribed to the chain
architecture: linear chains mainly unfold along
MD for ZN-LLDPE, whereas chains with LCBs
unfold along both MD and TD for HP-LDPE.
</p>
<p>Even though M-LLDPE provides the best com-
promise of maximum puncture resistance and
quite high and well-equilibrated tear resistance,
it is not as good as ZN-LLDPE with respect to the
tear resistance level. This is attributed to the
nearly isotropic structure with an almost random
chain distribution, which reduces the probability
of chain segments lying within the film plane.
These segments are the ones most prone to stop
crack propagation. It is, therefore, suggested that
orthotropy, with some degree of chain extension
within the film plane, would be the better texture
for optimized tear and puncture resistance for
either ZN-LLDPE or M-LLDPE. HP-LDPE will
never reach equivalent use properties because it
lacks strain hardening.
</p>
<p>The generalization of our conclusions to all
kinds of PEs produced by similar polymerization
methods cannot be made without precautions.
However, a general conclusion is that the average
relaxation time in the melt is a major factor for
the development of texture and mechanical an-
isotropy. This may help us to understand some of
the specific properties reported in the literature,
notably in consideration of the time allowed to the
various sequences of the blowing process. The
knowledge of a whole distribution of relaxation
times, in combination with a complete molecular
characterization, would be a promising way to
progress into the structure&#8211;property relation-
ships of PE films.
