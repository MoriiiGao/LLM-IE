<p>The effects of boron nitride (BN) content and particle size on the thermal properties of BN/high density polyethylene (HDPE)
</p>
<p>composites were investigated. The thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of the composites were dependent on the BN content.
</p>
<p>For composites with same amount of BN, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with an increase in the size of the

<p>BN particles. Composites with a mixture of different-sized BN particles exhibited higher thermal conductivities than those of composites
</p>
<p>with single-sized BN particles. The specific heat capacities of the composites were also affected by the BN content and particle size.

<p>Several theoretical models were employed to predict the effective thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted values were

</div><div><p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>For electronic packaging applications, materials with high
thermal conductivities are required to dissipate the heat
generated by the electronic component effectively. Polymers
are often used in these applications, in addition to being
employed as substrate materials, because of their low dielectric
properties and ease of processing. However, the thermal
conductivities of polymers are usually very low. Therefore,
there is a need to investigate ceramics-filled polymer compo-
sites that have high thermal conductivities [1&#8211;4].
</p>
<p>Generally, the thermal conductivity of ceramic-filled
polymer composites increases with increasing ceramic
content and particle size. Particles with a high aspect ratio
such as flake- or fibre-shaped particles exhibit the bridging
phenomenon to a larger degree. This assists in the forma-
tion of a conductive path because the percolation threshold
for such particles is lower than that of spherical particles.
However, high-aspect-ratio particles have low packing
densities due to their increased porosity [3]. Usage of a
mixture of different-sized ceramic particles would increase
the thermal conductivity of composites [5&#8211;8], as the</p>

</div><div><p>packing densities of such composites would be higher than
those of composites with single-sized ceramic particles.
Flakes of BN were used as the filler in this study due to
</p>
<p>their high conductivity, excellent temperature resistance,
light-weight nature, and moderate cost [1]. High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) was used as the polymer matrix since
HDPE is an engineering thermo-plastic used in several
industrial applications due to its low cost, desirable
mechanical properties, and ease of processing.
Therefore, the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE com-
</p>
<p>posites was investigated on the basis of the volume fraction
(Vf) and size of the BN flakes. In addition, several
theoretical models were employed to predict the effective
thermal conductivities of the composites, and the predicted
values were compared with those obtained experimentally.</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>2. Experimental procedures
</p>
<p>Powders (99.5%, Changsung Corp., Korea) comprising
BN flakes of different sizes were chosen as the fillers for the
polymer matrix composites. The sizes of the BN flakes in
the ceramic powders used in this study were 3 mm, 10 mm,
and 20 mm. HDPE (99.9%, Yuhwa Korea Petrochemical
Ind. Co., Korea) was used as a matrix for the composites.
The BN powders and HDPE were weighed as per the</p>

200 1C at a speed of 30 rpm for 20 min. The mixture was
hot-pressed under a pressure of 15 MPa for 30 min at
200 1C and cooled to room temperature.
</p>
<p>The apparent densities of the composites were measured
by the Archimedes&#8217; method. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (D/Max-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Japan) was used to
determine the content and the size of the particles in the
BN powders. The microstructures of the composites were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-
6500F, Jeol, Japan). The specific heat capacities (Cp) and
the thermal diffusivities were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model DSC 200F3, Netzsch,
Germany) and by a laser flash apparatus (LFA) (Model
LFA447, Netzsch, Germany), respectively. The thermal
conductivities of the composites were obtained using their
densities, specific heat capacities, and thermal diffusivities.</p>

</p>
<p>3.1. Physical properties of composites
</p>
<p>The X-ray diffraction patterns for the BN/HDPE
composites with various volume fractions (Vf) and
BN-particle sizes are shown in Fig. 1. The semi-
crystalline phase of HDPE and the single crystalline phase
of BN (JCPDS no. 37-109) could be detected. With an
increase in the BN content, the intensity of the peak for
HDPE decreased. For a given BN content, the intensity of
the peak for HDPE increased with a decrease in the size of
the BN particles.
</p>
<p>The peaks for the composites with a mixture of 3 mm-
and 20 mm-sized BN particles exhibited intensities that
were between the intensities of the peaks for the compo-
sites with BN particles with sizes of 3 mm and 20 mm,</p>

</div><div><p>respectively. The XRD patterns did not show peaks for
any reaction compounds of BN and HDPE, suggesting
that no chemical reaction took place between the BN
particles and HDPE.
Fig. 2 shows the apparent and theoretical densities of the
</p>
<p>composites with various volume fractions (Vf). The appar-
ent and theoretical densities of the composites increased
with an increase in the BN content as the density of the BN
particles is higher than that of HDPE. For composites with
same amount of BN particles, the apparent density did not
change markedly with BN-particle size. With increasing
BN content, the difference between the apparent and
theoretical densities of the composites increased because
of the pores induced at the interface between polymer and
ceramics [3].
SEM micrographs of the composites with various
</p>
<p>volume fractions and BN-particle sizes are shown in
Fig. 3. With increasing BN content (Fig. 3(a&#8211;c)), the
distance between the BN particles decreased. That is to
say that connectivity among the BN particles as well as the
interfacial area between BN and HDPE increased. The
composites with a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN
particles showed larger conductive networks than did the
composites with single-sized BN particles (Fig. 3(d) and
(e)). The composites with various volume fractions and
BN-particle sizes had the BN particles uniformly dispersed
within the HDPE matrix, with melted HDPE completely
covering the BN particles, resulting in the low porosity of
the composites.</p>

<p>The thermal diffusivities and specific heat capacities of
the composites with various volume fractions and BN-
particle sizes are shown in Table 1. With increasing BN
content, the thermal diffusivity of the composites
increased, while the specific heat capacity decreased. These</p>

</div><div><p>results are due to the fact that the thermal diffusivity of BN
is higher than that of HDPE, and its specific heat capacity is
lower than that of HDPE. The thermal diffusivity of the</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>composites increased with an increase in the size of the BN
particles due to the decrease in the interfacial thermal
barrier between BN and HDPE. However, the specific heat
capacity of the composites did not change markedly with
the size of the BN particles. A similar tendency has been
confirmed in BN/polybenzoxazine composites [9].
Fig. 4 shows the experimentally determined and theore-
</p>
<p>tically calculated thermal conductivities of the composites
with various volume fractions and BN-particle sizes. The
experimentally determined thermal conductivity of the
composites increased with increasing BN content due to
the thermal conductivity of BN being higher than that of
HDPE. For a given ceramic content, the thermal con-
ductivity of the composites increased with increasing BN-
particle size because the heat conducting paths were
thicker and the junctions had lower thermal resistance in
the composites with the larger particles of BN than in the
composites with smaller BN particles.
For electronic packaging applications, the ability to
</p>
<p>predict the thermal conductivity of the composites effec-
tively should be considered when designing ceramic/poly-
mer composites with high thermal conductivity. Several
theoretical models were employed to predict the thermal
conductivity of the composites with various volume frac-
tions and BN-particle sizes. The Bruggeman and Russell</p>

</div><div><p>models [6] were not used to fit the experimental data due to
the fact that the fillers used in this study were not spherical
or cubic in shape. However, the Nielsen&#8211;Lewis model
[6,10] was in good agreement with the experimental values
well up to Vf of 0.4, above which the model failed because
of the presence of pores, as shown in Fig. 4.
</p>
<p>This result is due to the fact that, unlike the other
models, the Nielsen&#8211;Lewis model includes a fitting para-
meter A (morphology factor) to describe the shape of the
filler. The Nielsen&#8211;Lewis model is based on the following
equation:
</p>
<p>leff &#188; lp
</p>
<p>1&#254;ABVf
</p>
<p>1&#2;cBVf
</p>
<p>; B&#188;
lc=lp
</p>
<p>&#2; &#3;
&#2;1
</p>
<p>lc=lp
</p>
<p>&#2; &#3;
&#254;A
</p>
<p>; c&#188; 1&#254;
1&#2;fm
</p>
<p>fm
2
</p>
<p>Vf
</p>
<p>&#240;1&#222;
</p>
<p>where leff, lp, and lc are the thermal conductivities of the
composites, polymer, and ceramic, respectively; Vf is
the volume faction of the ceramic; constant A is related
to the morphology of the composites (irregular-shaped
particles have a larger value of A than do spherical
particles (A&#188;1.5)); fm is maximum packing fraction. For
composites with same amount of BN particles, the values
of A and fm increased with increasing BN-particle sizes
(Fig. 4).
</p>
<p>Fig. 5 shows the thermal conductivity of BN/HDPE
composites with the volume fraction of BN equal to Vf of
0.3 and a mixture of 3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles.
For the composites with the Vf of 0.3 and a mixture of
3 mm- and 20 mm-sized BN particles, the thermal conduc-
tivity increased when Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles was
0.09. It then decreased with a further increase in the
volume fraction of the 3 mm-sized BN particles. These
results can be explained by the fact that the 3 mm-sized BN
particles fill the space between the 20 mm-sized BN parti-
cles until Vf of the 3 mm-sized BN particles reaches 0.09
(Fig. 3(f)). This leads to an increase in the number of
conductive paths.</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>4. Conclusions
</p>
<p>With increasing BN content, the thermal conductivities
and the thermal diffusivities of BN/HDPE composites
increased, while the specific heat capacities decreased.
For a given BN content, the thermal conductivity and
the thermal diffusivity of the composites increased with an
increase in the sizes of the BN particles. However, the
specific heat capacity of the composites did not change
markedly with the BN-particle size. The thermal conduc-
tivity of composites containing a mixture of different-sized
BN particles was higher than that of composites contain-
ing only single-sized BN particles (3 mm or 20 mm). The
experimentally determined values of thermal conductivity
were in good agreement with those obtained using the
Nielsen&#8211;Lewis model.</p>
