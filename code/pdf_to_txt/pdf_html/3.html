<p>ABSTRACT
</p>
<p>The crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers and molecular orientation of
</p>
<p>polymer have long been considered to be significant influencing factors on the
</p>
<p>thermal conductivity of polymer materials, but more clear-cut understanding on
</p>
<p>their impact on the thermal conductivity is still needed. In this work, poly-L-
</p>
<p>lactide (PLLA), whose crystallinity and orientation can be adjusted in a wide
</p>
<p>range, is selected to discuss the effect of degree of crystallinity and orientation
</p>
<p>on the thermal conductivity of PLLA. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature
</p>
<p>on the thermal conductivity is also discussed. PLLA compression-molded
</p>
<p>samples were heat-treated at 120 &#3;C to tune the crystallinity of the samples,
</p>
<p>while the degrees of orientation were tuned by stretching the amorphous PLLA
</p>
<p>bars at 60 &#3;C to different strains. It is found that environmental temperature of
</p>
<p>application affects the thermal conductivity obviously and the glass transition
</p>
<p>temperature of polymers shows a strong influence on the thermal conductivity
</p>
<p>of PLLA. Below Tg, the thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity
</p>
<p>increases with temperature and when the temperature is higher than Tg, the
</p>
<p>thermal conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity decreases remarkably.
</p>
<p>It is also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of PLLA increases with the
</p>
<p>increase in crystallinity, and the tensile strain linearly increases the thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity in the direction of molecular orientation and decreases the thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which are in agreement with other
</p>
<p>semicrystalline polymers that has been reported.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Introduction
</p>
<p>With the rapid development of science and tech-
</p>
<p>nologies, electric products are more and more highly
</p>
<p>integrated, which urgently pushes the exploitation of
</p>
<p>effective thermal management materials including
</p>
<p>thermally conductive polymers and polymer com-
</p>
<p>posites to be applied in various applications [1&#8211;7],
</p>
<p>such as packaging, electronic devices and energy
</p>
<p>storage. However, bulk polymers generally exhibit
</p>
<p>very low thermal conductivity (TC) in the range of
</p>
<p>0.1&#8211;0.5 W/(mK) [8, 9], so the development of poly-
</p>
<p>mer materials with enhanced thermal conductivity
</p>
<p>has become a great challenge to meet great increasing
</p>
<p>demands [10&#8211;15]. It has been accepted that the
</p>
<p>polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the overall TC
</p>
<p>of polymer composites [16]. It is therefore necessary
</p>
<p>to clearly clarify the influence of important factors
</p>
<p>such as crystallinity and molecular orientation on the
</p>
<p>TC of polymers.
</p>
<p>Generally, crystalline polymers exhibit higher TC
</p>
<p>than amorphous polymers due to the ordered struc-
</p>
<p>ture, while the random chain conformation in amor-
</p>
<p>phous polymers reduces the phonon mean free path
</p>
<p>and causes phonon scattering [17]. In early study,
</p>
<p>Hansen et al. [18] reported that the TC of high density
</p>
<p>polyethylene can be improved by increasing the
</p>
<p>crystallinity and lamellar thickness via tuning pro-
</p>
<p>cessing conditions. Subsequently, Choy and co-
</p>
<p>worker [19] found that the influence of crystallinity
</p>
<p>on the TC of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was
</p>
<p>affected by temperature. The TC of PET decreases
</p>
<p>with increasing crystallinity at low temperature, but
</p>
<p>increases with crystallinity at temperatures above
</p>
<p>30 K. The peculiar behavior was interpreted from the
</p>
<p>increasing thermal boundary resistance due to
</p>
<p>acoustic mismatch at amorphous&#8211;crystalline interface
</p>
<p>when the temperature is lowered. Crystallization was
</p>
<p>also reported to be responsible for the higher TC in
</p>
<p>other semicrystalline polymers [20, 21]. The higher
</p>
<p>the crystallinity, the higher the thermal conductivity.
</p>
<p>As heat transports more easily along polymer
</p>
<p>chains than perpendicular to the polymer chain,
</p>
<p>polymers exhibit significant anisotropy in their ther-
</p>
<p>mally conductive properties [22]. Numerous experi-
</p>
<p>mental studies on polymer chain orientation for TC
</p>
<p>enhancement have been reported. As a typical
</p>
<p>semicrystalline polymer, polyethylene (PE) has been
</p>
<p>mostly used to study the effect of orientation on TC
</p>
<p>[18, 23&#8211;28]. TC of other semicrystalline polymers
</p>
<p>stretched to different draw ratio including poly-
</p>
<p>oxymethylene (POM), polypropylene (PP),
</p>
<p>polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET was also
</p>
<p>studied [29]. The general result is that TC parallel to
</p>
<p>the orientation direction rapidly increases with
</p>
<p>increasing strain or draw ratio, while TC perpendic-
</p>
<p>ular to the orientation direction decreases slightly.
</p>
<p>But in these studies on the effect of the orientation,
</p>
<p>TC was also influenced by the crystallization nature
</p>
<p>of the polymers. To clarify how chain alignment
</p>
<p>affects TC during drawing, purely amorphous poly-
</p>
<p>mers were studied [30&#8211;34]. Early studies [31, 32]
</p>
<p>showed that the TC of stretched polymethyl
</p>
<p>methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) can be
</p>
<p>increased in the stretching direction, but the increase
</p>
<p>was small. However, it was found recently that
</p>
<p>polythiophene nanofibers can achieve a TC up to
</p>
<p>4.4 W/(m K), more than 20 times greater than the
</p>
<p>bulk polymer through chain alignment [34]. Lu et al.
</p>
<p>[35] also evidenced the molecular alignment in
</p>
<p>amorphous region played a very important role in
</p>
<p>the enhancement of thermal conductivity of
</p>
<p>semicrystalline polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber.
</p>
<p>PLLA is a plant-derived biodegradable polymer
</p>
<p>material. However, low thermal conductivity restricts
</p>
<p>its application in engineering and electronic fields. To
</p>
<p>expand the applications of PLLA, many studies have
</p>
<p>been conducted to improve the TC of PLLA via
</p>
<p>compounding with thermally conductive fillers
</p>
<p>[36&#8211;41], but the basic influencing factors from the
</p>
<p>polymer itself have not been well addressed, which is
</p>
<p>hopefully to provide supporting for fabrication of
</p>
<p>high thermally conductive PLLA composites. Also,
</p>
<p>owing to that PLLA exhibits very low crystallization
</p>
<p>kinetics [42&#8211;44], the amorphous state by quenching
</p>
<p>and a wide range of degrees of crystallinity by
</p>
<p>isothermal crystallization at different temperature for
</p>
<p>different periods of time can be easily achieved [45].
</p>
<p>These features provide a good candidate to elucidate
</p>
<p>the effect of crystallinity and molecular orientation on
</p>
<p>the TC of semicrystalline polymers.
</p>
<p>In this study, the crystallinity of PLLA was tuned
</p>
<p>by melt crystallization at 120 &#3;C for different minutes.
</p>
<p>Various degrees of orientation of PLLA were realized
</p>
<p>by stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 &#3;C with
</p>
<p>the same speed to different strains. WAXD was car-
</p>
<p>ried out to characterize the crystallinity and degree of
</p>
<p>orientation of PLLA. DSC, density measurement and
</p>
<p>laser flash method were performed together to reveal

</p>
<p>ture and orientation of molecular chains. The results
</p>
<p>showed that TC of PLLA with different crystallinity
</p>
<p>was affected obviously by ambient temperature and
</p>
<p>the maximum value appeared at Tg. TC of PLLA
</p>
<p>increases with increasing crystallinity, and TC of
</p>
<p>PLLA parallel to the orientation direction increases
</p>
<p>with increasing tensile strain, while the one perpen-

<p>the effect of crystallinity and orientation on the
</p>
<p>thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers.

</p>
<p>Experimental section
</p>
<p>Materials and sample preparation
</p>
<p>PLLA (trade name 4032D, Nature Works LLC) was
</p>
<p>used. The average weight molecular weight (Mw) and
</p>
<p>the polydispersity index (PDI) are 2.1 9 105 g/mol
</p>
<p>and 1.7. The melting temperature is 167.2 &#3;C, mea-
</p>
<p>sured by differential scanning calorimetry at a heat-
</p>
<p>ing rate of 10 &#3;C/min.
</p>
<p>PLLA granules were dried in a blast drying oven at
</p>
<p>60 &#3;C for 12 h, and then melted in the mixer of a
</p>
<p>torque rheometer with a rotational speed of 50 rpm at
</p>
<p>190 &#3;C for 5 min. After that, the resulted materials
</p>
<p>were compressed into sheets with the thickness of
</p>
<p>about 0.5 mm at 190 &#3;C for 3 min under a pressure of
</p>
<p>10 MPa. The melted PLLA sheet was immediately
</p>
<p>transferred to isothermal crystallization at 120 &#3;C for
</p>
<p>different minutes (0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 40 min)
</p>
<p>under a pressure of 10 MPa and then cooled quickly
</p>
<p>to obtain samples with different crystallinity. The
</p>
<p>resulted samples were designated as 120-X min, in
</p>
<p>which X stands for the compression time at 120 &#3;C.
Round disks with the diameter of 12.7 mm were cut
</p>
<p>from the 120-X min PLLA sheets for WAXD and
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity tests. Rectangular-shaped sample
</p>
<p>bars with the dimension of 20 mm (width) 9 80.0
</p>
<p>mm (length) were cut from amorphous 120-0 min
</p>
<p>PLLA sheets, and then stretched uniaxially at 60 &#3;C
using an Instron 5967 universal material testing
</p>
<p>machine at a stretching rate of 20 mm/min. The
</p>
<p>tensile strain was controlled to be 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
</p>
<p>The stretched bars designated as 60-20-Y, in which
</p>
<p>Y stands for the tensile strain, were measured by 2D
</p>
<p>wide angel X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to determine
</p>
<p>the degree orientation. Both the through-plane and
</p>
<p>in-plane thermal diffusivities of the stretched bars
</p>
<p>were tested.

</p>
<p>WAXD measurements and data analysis
</p>
<p>WAXD measurement of PLLA compression sheets
</p>
<p>isothermally crystallized at 120 &#3;C for different min-
</p>
<p>utes was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffrac-
</p>
<p>tometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k = 0.154 nm,
</p>
<p>40 kV, 25 mA) in the scanning range of 2h = 5&#3;&#8211;60&#3; at
a scan speed of 10&#3;/min at room temperature. The
</p>
<p>crystallinity was determined from the fractional area
</p>
<p>of the crystalline peaks to the total area [46].
</p>
<p>WAXD measurement of PLLA samples stretched to
</p>
<p>different strains at 60 &#3;C with the speed of 20 mm/
</p>
<p>min was carried out on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER 2D
</p>
<p>X-ray diffractometer with the reflection mode. The
</p>
<p>X-ray was generated using ImS micro Focus X-ray
</p>
<p>source generator with Cu target (k = 0.154 nm, 40 kV,
</p>
<p>40 mA). The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns were
</p>
<p>recorded on a VANTEC-500 detector system with a
</p>
<p>pixel size of 68 9 68 mm2. The distance from the
</p>
<p>sample to detector was 198 mm. The spot size of the
</p>
<p>beam was 0.5 mm.
</p>
<p>Density measurement
</p>
<p>The density of PLLA compression-molded samples
</p>
<p>with different crystallinity was measured by using
</p>
<p>MH-120E density meter according to Archimedes
</p>
<p>principle.
</p>
<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement
</p>
<p>The empty pan, sapphire standard and PLLA com-
</p>
<p>pression-molded samples with different crystallinity
</p>
<p>were measured by DSC (Q20, TA company). Samples
</p>
<p>were measured from - 80 to 90 &#3;C with heating rate
</p>
<p>of 10 &#3;C/min under nitrogen gas flow of 50 mL/min.

</p>
<p>faces of the samples were evenly sprayed with a thin
</p>
<p>graphite layer. The sample was then fixed according
</p>
<p>to the required test pattern and placed in the test
</p>
<p>chamber (LFA 467, Netzsch). PLLA compression-
</p>
<p>molded samples with different crystallinity were
</p>
<p>tested in the temperature ranging from - 70 to 80 &#3;C,
while the PLLA stretched samples with different
</p>
<p>degree of orientation were tested at 25 &#3;C.

<p>Results and discussion
</p>
<p>Effect of temperature and crystallinity
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA
</p>
<p>WAXD profiles of PLLA compression-molded sam-
</p>
<p>ples isothermally crystallized at 120 &#3;C for different
</p>
<p>period of time are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that
</p>
<p>the quenched PLLA compression-molded sample
</p>
<p>without isothermal crystallization (120-0 min) shows
</p>
<p>only a very broad diffraction peak of amorphous
</p>
<p>phase without any traces of crystalline peaks, clearly
</p>
<p>showing the amorphous nature of the sample owing
</p>
<p>to the extremely slow crystallization kinetics of
</p>
<p>PLLA. After isothermal crystallizing at 120 &#3;C, the
WAXD profile of the isothermally crystallized PLLA
</p>
<p>samples shows three peaks at 2h = 16.7&#3;, 19.0&#3; and
</p>
<p>22.3&#3;, respectively, corresponding to the diffraction
</p>
<p>peaks of (200)/(110), (203) and (015) planes of a
crystalline structure of PLLA. The diffraction inten-
</p>
<p>sity of the peaks increases with the extension of
</p>
<p>isothermal crystallization time, showing that
</p>
<p>isothermal treatment at 120 &#3;C can effectively pro-
</p>
<p>mote the crystallization of PLLA. By Gauss fitting of
</p>
<p>the WAXD profiles, the crystallinity of all the samples
</p>
<p>was calculated and is listed in Table 1. The results
</p>
<p>demonstrate that the crystallinity of PLLA isother-
</p>
<p>mally crystallized at 120 &#3;C increases with the
</p>
<p>extension of isothermal crystallizing time, and can
</p>
<p>even reach up to a level higher than 50%.
</p>
<p>The different crystallinity of PLLA samples leads to
</p>
<p>the differences of densities, which are listed in
</p>
<p>Table 2. It can be seen that although the crystallinity
</p>
<p>varies in a great range after crystallizing at 120 &#3;C for
</p>
<p>different time, the change in density, showing a slight
</p>
<p>increasing trends, is quite limited. However, when
</p>
<p>the crystallinity increases, the ratio of the ordered
</p>
<p>molecular chains in the system increases, leading to
</p>
<p>the decrease in the volume of the sample. That is why
</p>
<p>the density of PLLA increases a little with the
</p>
<p>increasing of crystallinity.
</p>
<p>The specific heat (Cp) was obtained by DSC Q20
</p>
<p>(TA Instruments, America) at a heating rate of 10 &#3;C/
min. The Cp values of PLLA compression samples
</p>
<p>with different crystallinity are calculated by Eq. (1):
</p>
<p>Cp &#188; Cp0m
0h= mH&#240; &#222; &#240;1&#222;
</p>
<p>where Cp and Cp0, m and m0, h and H are the specific
</p>
<p>heat, the weight and the heat flow of PLLA sample
</p>
<p>and sapphire standard, respectively. The specific heat
</p>
<p>of sapphire standard is given in the DSC software.
</p>
<p>The calculated specific heat of PLLA samples is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the specific heat
</p>
<p>increases linearly before 50 &#3;C. An abrupt increase in
</p>
<p>the specific heat is observed in the glass transition
</p>
<p>temperature range (50&#8211;70 &#3;C), resulting from the
</p>
<p>change of free volume of PLLA [47], and then specific
</p>
<p>heat remains constant for the samples with given
</p>
<p>crystallinity after Tg. Thermal diffusivities of PLLA
</p>
<p>samples with different crystallinity were measured
</p>
<p>by laser flash method, which is a non-contact tran-
</p>
<p>sient thermal measurement method widely used for
</p>
<p>measuring the thermal diffusivity (a). With all these
</p>
<p>parameters, the thermal conductivity of the samples
</p>
<p>can be derived through Eq. (2):
</p>
<p>k &#188; a&#2; q&#2; Cp &#240;2&#222;
</p>
<p>where q is the bulk density and Cp is the specific heat
</p>
<p>at a given pressure.

</p>
<p>tivity of PLLA samples with different crystallinity are

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows that the thermal
</p>
<p>diffusivity of PLLA samples with different crys-
</p>
<p>tallinity reduces moderately due to the decrease in
</p>
<p>the phonon mean free path when the temperature
</p>
<p>rises, but drops abruptly within the glass transition
</p>
<p>temperature range. Taking 120-40 as an example, the
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity decreases by 0.033 mm2/s from
</p>
<p>- 70 to 60 &#3;C, but decreases by 0.017 mm2/s sharply
</p>
<p>only from 60 to 80 &#3;C. The sudden drop can be
</p>
<p>explained in terms of molecular mobility [48]. But it
</p>
<p>should be noted that the abrupt drop trend around Tg
</p>
<p>becomes gentler with increasing crystallinity of PLLA
</p>
<p>samples. It can be understood from the fact that the
</p>
<p>crystallized fractions refine the amorphous phase of
</p>
<p>PLLA to a certain degree and hinder the molecular
</p>
<p>motion in amorphous regions which will reduce the
</p>
<p>phonon mean free path, especially at temperatures
</p>
<p>near the glass transition.
</p>
<p>Figure 3b shows the relationship between thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity of PLLA samples with different crys-
</p>
<p>tallinity and temperature. It can be found that the
</p>
<p>environmental temperature affects the thermal con-
</p>
<p>ductivity obviously. Notably, the glass transition
</p>
<p>temperature exerts a great influence on the thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity. In the glass state below Tg, thermal
</p>
<p>conductivities of all the PLLA samples with different
</p>
<p>crystallinity increase with temperature. In this tem-
</p>
<p>perature range, two mechanisms with opposite
</p>
<p>effects operate [48]. The thermal diffusivity decreases
</p>
<p>with temperature increasing, while the increase in

</p>
<p>thermal conductivity decreases remarkably. Such a
</p>
<p>process produces the maximum of the thermal con-
</p>
<p>ductivity near the glass transition temperature in the
</p>
<p>range of the measured temperatures. Meanwhile, it
</p>
<p>also can be seen that the thermal conductivity of
</p>
<p>PLLA samples increases with the increase in crys-
</p>
<p>tallinity of PLLA.
</p>
<p>To further analyze the effect of the crystallinity on
</p>
<p>the thermally conductive properties of PLLA, the
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal con-
</p>
<p>ductivity of PLLA samples at different temperatures
</p>
<p>are presented as a function of crystallinity in Fig. 4.
</p>
<p>The specific heat changes linearly with the increase in
</p>
<p>crystallinity of PLLA at different temperatures. The
</p>
<p>slope of the fitting curve decreases from 0.118 to
</p>
<p>- 0.46 with increasing temperature. It shows that the
</p>
<p>specific heat of PLLA decreases with increasing
</p>
<p>crystallinity when the temperature is higher than Tg,
</p>
<p>due to that Cp for amorphous phase is larger than
</p>
<p>crystal phase [49]. However, specific heat of PLLA
</p>
<p>samples increases slowly with the increasing crys-
</p>
<p>tallinity at temperatures below Tg. Thermal diffusiv-
</p>
<p>ity of PLLA increases linearly with increasing
</p>
<p>crystallinity, and the increasing rate keeps stable at
</p>
<p>the temperatures below Tg, while the increasing rate
</p>
<p>increases after Tg. When the amorphous phase is in
</p>
<p>the rubber state, the motion of the molecular chains
</p>
<p>reduces the phonon mean free path obviously, while
</p>
<p>with the increasing crystallinity, the mean free path
</p>
<p>increases distinctly. That is why the thermal diffu-
</p>
<p>sivity increases obviously with increasing crys-
</p>
<p>tallinity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of PLLA
</p>
<p>samples as a result of the specific heat and thermal
</p>
<p>diffusivity increases with increasing crystallinity.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Though the specific heat decreases with increasing
</p>
<p>crystallinity after Tg, the thermal diffusivity com-
</p>
<p>pensates more for the thermal conductivity. The
</p>
<p>increase in thermal conductivity of PLLA samples
</p>
<p>with increasing crystallinity is in agreement with that
</p>
<p>of other semi-crystallized polymers. However, it
</p>
<p>should be noted that TC of PLLA is not significantly
</p>
<p>increased with crystallinity. TC of PLLA with the
</p>
<p>crystallinity of 56% (120-40) is 0.196 W/mK at 20 &#3;C,
only 0.025 W/mK larger than the thermal conduc-
</p>
<p>tivity of amorphous PLLA (120-0).
</p>
<p>Effect of molecular orientation
on the thermal conductivity of PLLA
</p>
<p>To obtain PLLA with different degrees of orientation
</p>
<p>and to exclude the influence of crystallization,
</p>
<p>amorphous PLLA rectangle samples (120-0 min)
</p>
<p>were stretched to different strains uniaxially at 60 &#3;C
with the stretching rate of 20 mm/min. Different
</p>
<p>positions were marked on the original bars. It is
</p>
<p>found in Fig. S2(a) that the strain of every marked
</p>
<p>length is consistent, which provides us proof for our
</p>
<p>assumption that the orientation of different positions
</p>
<p>on the tensile bar is similar. Taking 60-20-4 as an
</p>
<p>example, 2D WAXD patterns of different positions on
</p>
<p>the tensile bar are shown in Fig. S2(b) to verify the
</p>
<p>degree of orientation. It shows that WAXD diffrac-
</p>
<p>tions of the three different positions are almost the
</p>
<p>same on the meridian and the isotropic scattering
</p>
<p>halo develops into the two arcs along the meridian.
</p>
<p>From the azimuth scan curve, it can be seen that the
</p>
<p>curves of the &#8216;&#8216;upper, middle, down&#8217;&#8217; parts are basi-
</p>
<p>cally also the same. These results indicate that
</p>
<p>degrees of orientation of different positions along
</p>
<p>drawing direction of the tensile bar are the same, and
</p>
<p>the differences are negligible. This facilitates subse-
</p>
<p>quent preparation of specimens for tests of in-plane
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity.
</p>
<p>The middle part of PLLA bars stretched to different
</p>
<p>strains is chosen to measure the degrees of orienta-
</p>
<p>tion by 2D WAXD. The 2D WAXD patterns are
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 5. The un-stretched PLLA shows reg-
</p>
<p>ular concentric rings, indicating that the initial PLLA
</p>
<p>bar is amorphous and isotropic. With the increase in
</p>
<p>tensile strain, the isotropic halo gradually concen-
</p>
<p>trates to the meridian, which indicates that amor-
</p>
<p>phous chains of PLLA samples get orientated
</p>
<p>gradually along the drawing direction, and the
</p>
<p>strength increases gradually. In this process, no
</p>
<p>obvious crystal diffraction occurs. The meridian
</p>
<p>intensity profiles extracted from the WAXD patterns
</p>
<p>in Fig. 5b also show a very broad scattering peak of
</p>
<p>amorphous phase without any traces of crystalline
</p>
<p>phases. These results clearly demonstrated that the
</p>
<p>stretched PLLA bars with different strains are all
</p>
<p>amorphous and a series of PLLA with different
</p>
<p>degrees of orientation have been achieved to further
</p>
<p>reveal the influence of orientation on the thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity of PLLA.
</p>
<p>Both the in-plane and through-plane thermal dif-
</p>
<p>fusivity of the stretched and un-stretched PLLA
</p>
<p>samples were measured at 25 &#3;C. The thermal

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>conductivities are calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the
</p>
<p>specific heat and the density are constant, which are
</p>
<p>the values of the aforementioned PLLA 120-0 min
</p>
<p>(specific heat: 1.195 J/g K, density: 1.243 g/cm3). The
</p>
<p>results are shown in Fig. 6. The relation between
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity in the in-plane direction and
</p>
<p>tensile strain is opposite to the relation between
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity in the through-plane direction
</p>
<p>and tensile strain. The thermal diffusivity in the in-
</p>
<p>plane direction increases as the tensile strain increa-
</p>
<p>ses, while the thermal diffusivity of PLLA samples in
</p>
<p>the through-plane direction decreases with the
</p>
<p>increase in tensile strain. This is owing to that the
</p>
<p>thermal energy transports more efficiently parallel to
</p>
<p>the tensile direction, i.e., along the polymer chain,
</p>
<p>which consists of the strong covalent bonds, than
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the polymer chain, where the ther-
</p>
<p>mal energy is carried by the means of weak van der
</p>
<p>Waals interaction of molecules [22]. That is to say, the
</p>
<p>phonon mean free path along the tensile direction (in-
</p>
<p>plane direction) is larger than that perpendicular to
</p>
<p>the tensile direction (through-plane direction).
</p>
<p>Therefore, with the increase in orientation, the ther-
</p>
<p>mal diffusivity in the in-plane direction increases,
</p>
<p>while the one in the through-plane direction decrea-
</p>
<p>ses. As the specific heat and density are constant, the
</p>
<p>variation of thermal conductivity (k) with the degree
</p>
<p>of orientation is consistent with the variation of the
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity with the degree of orientation.
</p>
<p>The thermal conductivity in the in-plane direction
</p>
<p>(k//) increases linearly with the increase in tensile
</p>
<p>strain, and thermal conductivity in the through-plane
</p>
<p>direction (k\) decreases linearly with the increase in
</p>
<p>tensile strain. When the tensile strain is 4, the TC in
</p>
<p>the in-plane direction of PLLA is 0.348 W/mK, while
</p>
<p>the TC in the through-plane direction decreases to
</p>
<p>0.125 W/mK. The relative thermal conductivities (k/
</p>
<p>k0)-strain data are also given in Fig. 7, showing that
</p>
<p>the relative in-plane thermal conductivity (k///k0) is
</p>
<p>low, only around 2 when tensile strain reaches to 4.
</p>
<p>Such a linear relationship between k (k// and k\) and
</p>
<p>strain and low relative in-plane thermal conductivity
</p>
<p>have also been observed previously for other amor-
</p>
<p>phous polymers such as PS, PMMA, PC, etc. [30, 32].

<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this work, different crystallinity and degree of
</p>
<p>orientation of PLLA were fabricated by isothermal
</p>
<p>crystallization at 120 &#3;C for different minutes and
</p>
<p>stretching the amorphous PLLA bars at 60 &#3;C at the
</p>
<p>same speed to different strains, respectively. We have
</p>
<p>demonstrated the effect of temperature, crystallinity
</p>
<p>and degree of orientation on the thermal conductivity
</p>
<p>of bulk PLLA samples. The thermal conductivity of
</p>
<p>PLLA with different crystallinity was affected obvi-
</p>
<p>ously by temperature. Before Tg, the thermal con-
</p>
<p>ductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity
</p>
<p>increases with temperature, mainly resulting from
</p>
<p>the increasing specific heat. As the temperature is
</p>
<p>further increased to be higher than Tg, the thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity of PLLA with different crystallinity
</p>
<p>decreases remarkably due to the obvious drop of
</p>
<p>thermal diffusivity. It demonstrates that thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity of PLLA increases with the increase in
</p>
<p>crystallinity, but the increasing rate is quite limited.
</p>
<p>With orientation, the conductivity was increased in
</p>
<p>the direction of molecular orientation and decreased
</p>
<p>in the perpendicular direction. The reciprocal of the
</p>
<p>two thermal conductivities in different directions of
</p>
<p>PLLA stretched to different strains fit a linear
</p>
<p>relationship.
