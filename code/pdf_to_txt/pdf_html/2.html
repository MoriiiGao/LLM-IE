<p>Decreased Thermal Conductivity
of Polyethylene Chain Influenced
by Short Chain Branching
In this paper, we have studied the effect of short branches (side chains) on the thermal
conductivity (TC) of a polyethylene (PE) chain. With a reverse nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics (RNEMD) method, TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain are
simulated and compared. It shows that the branch has a positive effect to decrease the
TC of a PE chain. The TC of the PE-ethyl chain decreases with the number density
increase of branches, until the density becomes larger than about eight ethyl per 200 seg-
ments, where the TC saturates to be only about 40% that of a pristine PE chain. Because
of different weights, different branches will cause a different decrease of TCs, and a
heavy branch will lead to a lower TC than a light one. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Not only a high thermal conductivity (TC) but also a quite low
TC is desired for polymers because of their wide applications
[1&#8211;6], such as a high TC for application as a thermal interface
material [7,8] and a low TC for application as a thermal insulation
material. Single polymer chains and highly aligned polymer fibers
have attracted a wide attention due to their potential high TC
[9&#8211;16]. Although a single polymer chain may possess a high TC,
polymers are generally regarded as a thermal insulator because of
their very low thermal conductivities on the order of 0.1 W m&#2;1
</p>
<p>K&#2;1 [17]. One of the reasons for the low TC is that the polymer
chains are randomly coiled in the polymers, which effectively
shortens the mean free path (MFP) of heat-carrying phonons
[18,19]. Another reason is that the TC of these polymers can be
significantly influenced by the morphology of individual chains
[14&#8211;17,20&#8211;22]. Besides these two reasons, the method to further
decrease the TC of a polymer is still desired to develop a thermal
insulator.
</p>
<p>There have already been some methods to reduce the TC of a
polymer chain. Liao et al. [23] tuned the TC of a polymer chain
by atomic mass modifications and found that heavy substituents
hinder heat transport substantially. Robbins and Minnich [16]
found that even perfectly crystalline polynorbornene has an
exceptionally low TC near the amorphous limit due to extremely
strong anharmonic scattering. Most recently, Ma and Tian [24]
studied the influence of the side chains on the TC of bottlebrush
polymers, and predicted that side chains dominate the heat con-
duction and could lead to a lower TC. Some other studies also
shown that chain segment disorder, or the random rotations of
segments in a chain, will lead to a lower TC [15,25&#8211;28].
</p>
<p>In this paper, we take the effect of branches into account to
probe a way to reduce the TC of a polymer. Considering the com-
plex structure of a polymer, we just focus on the polyethylene
(PE) chain. Results turn out that the TC of a PE chain with
branches can be decreased to be only 40% that of a pristine chain.
The paper is organized as follows: first, a reverse nonequilibrium
</p>
<p>molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method is introduced; and then
the effects of backbone chain length, branching chain location,
branching chain type, and the number density of branching chains
are simulated and discussed. This study is expected to provide
some fundamental guidance to obtain a polymer with a low TC.
</p>
<p>2 Simulation Method
</p>
<p>The materials studio is applied to build the initial configuration
of the PE chain and the modified PE chain. The PE chain is estab-
lished by replicating the PE segments which is the unit cell of
PE&#8217;s idealized bulk lattice structure with a length of 2.507 A&#778;. The
schematic structures of a pristine PE chain and a PE-ethyl chain
are shown in Fig. 1. After building the PE chain, with the COM-
PASS II potential [29&#8211;32], we first relax the system in an NVT
(constant number of atoms, temperature, and volume) ensemble at
a temperature of 300 K for 125 ps, where the Nose&#8211;Hoover ther-
mostat [33,34] is applied to obtain the constant temperature. And
then, a NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy)
ensemble is used to release the thermal stress. In the simulation
process, we double-check that the total energy has reached mini-
mum and becomes unchangeable at the end of NVT and NVE
ensembles to make sure that our systems have already been
equilibrated.
</p>
<p>To calculate TC, the RNEMD [35,36] simulation is performed
on the well equilibrated structures to establish a temperature gra-
dient. In the RNEMD method, each of the simulation boxes is
divided into several slabs with a periodic boundary in the heat
transfer direction. As that shown in Fig. 2, the simulation system
is divided into several slabs (20 to 200 slabs, depending on the
chain length), slab 0 is the &#8220;hot&#8221; slab, and the slab N/2 is the
&#8220;cold&#8221; slab. Other slabs are used to obtain the temperature distri-
butions. The heat flux is created by exchanging velocities of par-
ticles in cold and hot slabs. The cold slab donates its &#8220;hottest&#8221;
particles (particles with the highest kinetic energy) to the hot slab
in exchange for the latter&#8217;s &#8220;coolest&#8221; particles (particles with the
lowest kinetic energy). Performing this exchange periodically
results in the heating up of the hot slab and cooling down of the
cold slab. This process eventually yields a steady-state tempera-
ture gradient due to thermal conduction through slabs separating
the cold and hot slabs. The TC is calculated exactly by the
relationship

tion time t, m is the mass of the atoms, and &#2;c and &#2;h are the
velocities of the identical mass particles that participate in the
exchange procedure from the cold and hot slabs, respectively. A is
the cross-sectional area which is selected to be 14.7 A&#778;2 with a
branch-caused uncertainty less than 1.6% as listed in Table 1.
Such a small difference between cross-sectional areas will not
lead to a large TC difference as that caused by branches (will be
discussed later). The TC present in this work could be scaled by a
different cross-sectional area for a comparison. With a time-step
</p>
<p>of 1 fs, a total simulation time of 0.1 ns is taken to get a good lin-
ear temperature distribution. The temperature which is adopted to
calculate the temperature gradient is averaged through every 1000
simulation steps (1 ps). The temperature fluctuation in the simula-
tion can be reduced by this average method. With heat flux printed
out every 0.1 ps, the TC is calculated at the last step. The tempera-
ture distribution in a PE chain with a length of 100 segments is
shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The linear temperature region is
fitted to obtain the temperature gradient for the calculation of the
effective TC by using the Fourier&#8217;s law. The TC calculated at dif-
ferent simulation times is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that 0.1 ns is
long enough to get a converged TC.
</p>
<p>3 Results and Discussion
</p>
<p>First, the length dependence of the TC of a pristine PE chain is
investigated and compared with that in early researches. And
then, the TC of the pristine PE chains with different lengths is
compared with that of a PE-ethyl chain. Third, the effect of the
branch arrangement is considered. Finally, the influence of the
branch type and the number density of branches are taken into
account.
</p>
<p>3.1 Length Dependence of TC. Thermal conductivities of
the pristine PE chain with different chain lengths at 300 K are first
simulated and presented in Fig. 4(a). Previous works [14,37,38]
about the pristine PE chains are also added in Fig. 4(a) for com-
parison. As that shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an obvious increase of
the TC with the increase of the chain length. Even with the length
increasing to be 200 nm, the TC still not converges, which sug-
gests that some portion of the phonons can still travel ballistically

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>in such a length. Our simulation work confirms that the TC of a
pristine PE chain will increase with the increasing number of seg-
ments (or chain length), and the TC of a single PE chain is several
orders of magnitude larger than that of a PE polymer. In Fig. 4(a),
the TC difference between different works should be attributed to
the application of different simulation methods, considering that
the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method is applied in our
and the work of Hu et al. and the equilibrium molecular dynamics
method is utilized in the work of Ni et al. and Liu and Yang. It
seems that a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method will
give a higher TC than an equilibrium molecular dynamics method.
This was also noticed in other studies [39,40], and some explana-
tions can be found there.
</p>
<p>Plotting 1/k against 1/L in Fig. 4(b), we can see that with the
increase of 1/L, the 1/k first increases rapidly and then saturates to
a linear increase. The method by extrapolating the linear relation-
ship between the inverse of the TC (1/k) and the inverse of the
sample length (1/L) to get the TC with an infinite length fails.
This failure is attributed to the divergent thermal conductivity at
1/L! 0 where 1/k! 0, which has already been carefully studied
and explained with theoretical and molecular dynamics methods
in Ref. [41], more details can be found there.
</p>
<p>Thermal conductivities of the pristine PE chain and the PE-
ethyl chain with lengths ranging from 100 to 500 segments (or
25.07&#8211;125.35 nm) are compared in Fig. 5. It turns out that both
TCs of the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain increase with
the increasing length, and the TC of a PE-ethyl chain is only about
75% that of a pristine PE chain. To illustrate the underlying mech-
anism of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain, the vibrational den-
sity of states (VDOS) is calculated by using the Fourier transform
</p>
<p>of the velocity autocorrelation function. Results are compared
between the pristine PE chain and the PE-ethyl chain with 50 seg-
ments, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering the low-frequency
(&lt;20 THz) phonons dominate the TC due to their high group
velocities and long MFPs [23], the lower VDOS of the PE-ethyl
chain in the low frequency should be responsible for the lower
TC, where the branch acts as a center of low-frequency-phonon
scattering.
</p>
<p>To further illustrate the phonon scattering caused by the branch-
ing chains, the phonon spectral energy density (SED) of the pris-
tine PE and PE-ethyl chains is calculated based on the velocity
output of MD simulations. The atomic velocities are obtained by a
NVE simulation at a temperature of 300 K. The frequency resolu-
tion is selected to be 0.01 THz with 0.1 ns NVE simulations, and
the wave-number is 0.02j/(2p/a), where j&#188; 2pn/aN, here a is the
lattice constant, N is the total number of unit cells along the heat
transfer direction (N&#188; 50 in this work), and n is an integer ranging
from 0 to N&#2; 1. More details about the calculation can be found
in Refs. [42&#8211;45]. Results are shown in Fig. 7 with the shading sig-
nifying the magnitude of the SED. The SED of a pristine PE chain
in Fig. 7(a) coincides with that in Ref. [16] which confirms the
reliability of our calculation. For each phonon mode in Fig. 7, the
range of frequencies is related to the anharmonicity of the poten-
tial and the rate of the phonon scattering. The situation when
branch atoms move far away from equilibrium positions may lead
to a significant broadening of the peaks in Fig. 7. Fitting the shape
of peak and valley profiles of SED at all branches to the Lorent-
zian function [42&#8211;45], the phonon relaxation time is obtained and
shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the magnitude of the phonon relaxa-
tion time is greatly reduced by branching chains, which should be

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>responsible for the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain. The redistribu-
tion of phonons and the smearing acoustic branches of the
PE-ethyl chain in Fig. 7(b) proves the result in Fig. 8 that there is
a more severe phonon scattering for a PE-ethyl chain than a pris-
tine PE chain.
</p>
<p>3.2 Influence of Branch Arrangements. The influence of
branch locations is considered in this part. For a pristine PE chain,
there are different locations from the simulation region boundary
to the branching ethyl. Five special locations are selected to
branch a short chain, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respec-
tively, as that shown in Fig. 9(a). The result in Fig. 9(b) confirms
that the presence of a branching chain can truly reduce the TC,
and the average TC of a PE-ethyl chain is about 0.7 times that of a
pristine PE chain. Our simulations also indicate that there is
almost a same TC for different locations in Fig. 9(b). This is
attributed to the periodic boundary condition in the simulation.
The small TC discrepancies between different locations should be
caused by the different distance of the branch from the simulation
boundary. If the boundary and the branching chains are both
thought as defects on a pristine PE chain, the TC with ethyl
located at the middle of the chain (P1) will be lower than other
TCs (P2, P3, P4, and P5), because of the small distance from the

results in Fig. 9(b).
</p>
<p>3.3 Influence of Branching Chain Types and Number Den-
sity of Branches. Seven different types of short chains are
branched on the middle segment of a PE chain, respectively, for
comparisons. They are different from the weight and the type of
chemical bonds between the backbone and the branch, as shown
in Fig. 10, which are listed as phenoxy group, phenyl group,
ethoxy group, methoxy group, ethyl group, ethylene group, and
hydroxy group, respectively. The black, red, and blue columns in
Fig. 10 stand for different chain lengths. The relative masses of
different branches are also shown in Fig. 10. We can see that all
types of branches can lead to a decrease of TC, and a heavy
branch leads to a lower TC than a light one, except for the ethyl-
ene group for which TC may be further decreased by a different
bond. It agrees with the conclusion in Ref. [23] that a chain modi-
fied by a heave atom possesses a lower TC than that modified by a
light one, where the modifying atom can be thought a special
short branch. We conclude that different branches will lead to a
different decrease of thermal conductivities because of the differ-
ent weights. More studies are still needed to probe the effect of
bonds between the backbone and the branch on the TC.
</p>
<p>The effect of the number density of branches is studied in this
part. The number density of branches is defined as the number of
branches divided by the number of PE segments. Two hundred
segments (50.14 nm) are applied as a periodic unit in the simula-
tion, and the ethyl group is selected as the branch. Considering
there are different locations on a PE chain to branch an ethyl
group, we only consider two special location arrangements, i.e.,
the aligned arrangement and the fork arrangement, as that shown
in Fig. 11(a). For the aligned arrangement of ten branching ethyl,
they are equally distributed on the PE chain, only a part of the
chain is shown in Fig. 11(a); for the fork arrangement of ten
branching ethyl, every two branching ethyl are located at the same
segment of the PE chain, as that shown in Fig. 11(a). The corre-
sponding TC of these two arrangements is shown in Fig. 11(b). It
shows that a larger number density of branches leads to a lower
TC for both arrangements. With an increase of the number density
of branches, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain finally converges to be
only about 40% that of the pristine PE chain. This can be under-
stood by that with the increase of the number density, the distance
between branches is reduced, and the long-MFP phonons will be
decreased until the TC converges to a constant value. It can be
predicted that if a PE-ethyl chain instead of a pristine PE chain is
used to build up a polymer, the TC of the polymer will be much
reduced, because of the lower TC of the PE-ethyl chain and the
additional mass of branches. What kind of a chain will lead to a
lower TC is the key point of this paper, and more studies are still
needed to figure out the effect of long branches on the TC of a
pristine chain [24].
</p>
<p>4 Conclusions
</p>
<p>It is desirable to further reduce the TC of a polymer for devel-
oping a thermal insulation material. In this paper, we take
branches into account to probe a way to reduce the TC of a chain.
With the RNEMD method, the TCs of the pristine PE chain and
the PE-ethyl chain are simulated and compared. Influences of the
chain length, branch arrangements, types, and number density of
branches are considered. Our results suggest that the branch has a
positive effect to reduce the TC of a PE chain. If the number den-
sity of ethyl branches becomes larger than eight ethyls per 200
segments, the TC of a PE-ethyl chain converges to be only about
40% that of a pristine PE chain. This conclusion will not be influ-
enced by the branch arrangements. Different branches cause a dif-
ferent decrease of thermal conductivities because of their different
weights, and a heavy branch leads to a lower TC than a light one.
This study is expected to provide some fundamental guidance to
obtain a polymer with a low TC.
