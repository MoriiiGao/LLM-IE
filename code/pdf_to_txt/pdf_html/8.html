<p><b>Abstract</b>&#8212;Oxygen plasma-treated quenched and annealed polypropylene (PP) films with different
crystallinities were investigated to characterize the surface rearrangement behavior during aging using
contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Optimum plasma conditions were
examined by varying the power, time and pressure. Less crystalline quenched PP showed a larger
increase in water contact angle and a larger decrease of oxygen atomic concentration during aging
than the more crystalline annealed PP, since the oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups, introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment, oriented towards or diffused faster into the bulk with lower crystallinity.
The degree of crosslinking on the surface was enhanced after plasma treatment and, in addition to
increased crystallinity, the crosslinked structure induced by plasma treatment restricted chain mobility
and lowered the aging rate of the PP surface.

<p><b>1. INTRODUCTION
</b></p>
<p>Although polypropylene (PP) possesses good mechanical and chemical properties,
its use has been restricted in various applications owing to its low surface energy.
The interest in plasma modification of polymer surfaces has gradually increased in
the plastics industry for the last 30 years, since it can improve, e.g. the wettability,
adhesion, biocompatibility and printability [1&#8211;5]. Moreover, plasma treatment can
be carried out within only a few nanometers of the surface without altering the bulk
properties of the polymer.

</p>
<p>Although the plasma treatment of polymers has become a mature technology,
research aimed at understanding the aging behavior of treated surfaces with time
of storage is still continuing. Enhanced hydrophilicity of the PP surface can
be obtained from hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl, which can be
introduced by oxygen plasma treatment. However, a commonly observed and
troublesome phenomenon is the deterioration of the beneficial surface properties
(hydrophilicity) with aging. Such an effect is easily manifested in contact-angle
measurements where one observes an increase in contact angle on long-term
storage. It has been suggested that this hydrophobic recovery is mainly due to two
processes [2, 5&#8211;7]: reorientation of polar chemical groups towards the bulk of the
material to reduce the surface energy, and the other is the diffusion of polar chemical
groups in the polymer matrix.
</p>
<p>This aging behavior is usually strongly affected by environmental conditions.
High temperature helps the polymer chain to move freely and accelerate the surface
rearrangement. On the other hand, in a high humidity, the water molecules are
adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface and these water molecules disturb the rotation
or diffusion of polar groups [1, 2, 6].
</p>
<p>The surface rearrangement due to reorientation and diffusion at the surface can
be reduced by limiting the mobility of polymer chains. The chain mobility mainly
occurs in an amorphous region and the mobility in a crystalline region is fairly
limited because of an orderly packed structure [8&#8211;11]. With highly crystalline
polymers, hydrophobic recovery would be reduced because the highly restricted
chain mobility in the crystalline region would hinder the rotational and translational
motions in the surface region after plasma treatment. Thus the restricted chain
mobility decreases the aging rate of the hydrophilic surface with a crystalline
polymer.
</p>
<p>The surface changes after plasma treatment were investigated using X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact-angle measurements. The effect of
crystallinity on aging was studied with quenched and annealed PP. The degree of
crosslinking was examined after plasma treatment by measuring the gel content and
the effect of crosslink density on aging was also investigated.
</p>
<p><b>2. EXPERIMENTAL
</b></p>
<p><i>2.1. Materials
</i></p>
<p>Isotactic polypropylene (PP, <i>M</i>w 250 000) was supplied in the form of pellets by
Daehan Yuwha (Ulsan, South Korea). These pellets were pressed and formed into
thin sheets (0.5 mm) on stainless steel plates at 220&#9702;C for 10 min with a mould
force of 50 kN. The molded sheets were then cleaned thoroughly in an ultrasonicator
using a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture for 20 min, dried using compressed air and stored
in a vacuum desiccator with 20% RH at room temperature.

</p>
<p><i>2.2. Methods
</i></p>
<p><i>2.2.1. Determination of crystallinity. </i>The crystallization process was conducted
after molding the PP samples. To prepare low-crystallinity PP, molten PP films im-
mediately after molding were quenched into liquid nitrogen to reduce crystalliza-
tion of the polymer. Thermal treatment for a long time (24 h) at high temperature
(145&#9702;C) was carried out to increase the degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity
of the above two PP samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) according to the standard procedure mentioned in the literature [12]. The
empirical heat of fusion for 100% crystalline PP was set at 187 J/g [13]. The crys-
tallinity was also obtained by wide-angle X-ray scattering spectra from X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD). As the crystallinity determined from DSC or XRD does not repre-
sent surface crystallinity, so surface crystallinity was determined using the grazing
incident angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) at 8C1 beamline of PAL (Pohang Accelera-
tion Laboratory). An incident angle of 0<i>.</i>1&#9702; was selected for GIXD and the depth of
penetration (<i>&#964; </i>) at 0<i>.</i>1&#9702; grazing angle was calculated to be 100 nm from the following
equation [14]:
</p>
<p><i>&#964; </i>= sin2 <i>&#952; </i>&#8722; sin2 <i>&#968;
</i></p>
<p>2<i>&#181; </i>sin <i>&#952; </i>cos <i>&#968;
(&#945; </i>= <i>&#952; </i>+ <i>&#968;), </i>(1)
</p>
<p>where <i>&#945; </i>is the angle of incidence, <i>&#952; </i>is one-half the scattering angle, <i>&#968; </i>is the tilt
angle and <i>&#181; </i>is the linear absorption coefficient. The crystallinities of quenched and
annealed PP obtained from DSC, XRD and GIXD are shown in Table 1.
</p>
<p><i>2.2.2. Plasma treatment of PP samples. </i>Cleaned PP samples were treated
with oxygen plasma using a home-made capacitively-coupled plasma generator
operating at 13.56 MHz. To obtain the optimum conditions (power, time and
pressure), plasma-generating conditions were varied and the following optimum
conditions were selected from the results of water contact-angle measurements:
power, pressure and treatment time of 110 W, 3.33 Pa (2<i>.</i>5 &#215; 10&#8722;2 Torr) and
60 s, respectively. Following the plasma treatment, the samples were washed
ultrasonically in a 1 : 1 ethanol/water mixture to remove the low-molecular-weight

<p><i>2.2.3. Contact-angle measurements. </i>Contact-angle measurements on the
plasma-treated samples were performed at ambient temperature by the sessile drop
method with a contact-angle goniometer (CA-A, Kyowa Surface Science, Japan).
The equilibrium contact angle of water on untreated PP was found to be 100&#9702;. An
average of at least six readings was reported in each case. The error limit in the
measurement of contact angle was around &#177;0<i>.</i>5&#9702;. The contact angle of n-octane
in water was measured using the transparent glass cell and doubly bent needle as
shown in Fig. 1 to investigate the change in PP surfaces in the water environment.
</p>
<p><i>2.2.4. XPS analysis. </i>The chemical surface atomic composition of plasma-treated
polymer samples was investigated by XPS. The measurements were performed with
a Perkin-Elmer PHI-5400 Photoelectron Spectrometer using Mg K<i>&#945; </i>X-ray source
(1253.6 eV, 350 W). The C1s and O1s spectra of the samples were recorded with
0.2 eV interval energy. The C1s spectra of the untreated and oxygen plasma-treated
quenched PP are shown in Fig. 2. The operating pressure during analysis was in the
range of 10&#8722;9 Torr. Angle-resolved XPS measurements were carried out at take-off
angles of 20&#9702; (3.4 nm depth) and 90&#9702; (10 nm depth) for depth profiling of the treated
surfaces both before and after aging, and sampling depth for each take-off angle was
calculated from equation (2) [1, 16, 17]:

<p>hydrophilicity of surface, a longer time or high power was required. As the
treatment time decreased, more power was needed to obtain a water contact angle
under 10 degrees. Low power cannot generate high density of ions with an energy
higher than the bond energy of C H to generate radicals on the PP surface and,
thus, longer treatment time can increase the number of radicals.
</p>
<p>The effect of pressure on the oxygen plasma treatment of PP is shown in the
Fig. 4 with 100 W for 2 min. The water contact angle decreased as the pressure
dropped and the lowest water contact angle was observed at 3.33 Pa. At lower
chamber pressures, the mean free paths of the ions and electrons are longer, and
the ions can strike the surface with a relatively low loss of kinetic energy. At
high pressure, however, the intensity of collisions between the ions and the neutral
molecules increases, with the particles losing kinetic energy before colliding with
the surface, resulting in low generation of radicals [21]. Below the pressure of
3.33 Pa, the water contact angle increased, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. At too
low pressure, the number of particles (neutral molecules) is low and the generation
of ions is little, since ions are generated from the collision of electrons with neutral
molecules. Even if the ions strike the surface of the polymer without loss of kinetic
energy, the number of collisions between the ions and the surface is not high and
there are not enough radicals formed on the surfaces.

<p>From the above experiment, 3.33 Pa pressure, 1 min time and 110 W Rf power
were chosen as optimum process conditions and all oxygen plasma treatments were
carried out under these conditions.
</p>
<p><i>3.2. XPS results
</i></p>
<p>The surfaces of the oxygen plasma treated PP samples were characterized with XPS
(Fig. 5). Before aging, the oxygen concentration of the surface with 20&#9702; take-off
angle (approx. 3.4 nm depth) was 10% more than that of the surface with 90&#9702; take-
off angle (approx. 10 nm). The decrease of oxygen concentration with increasing
depth from the surface reveals that reactions of polymer chains with oxygen plasma
occurred in a very shallow surface region. For the generation of oxygen species,
carbon radicals had to be formed by the accelerated oxygen ions in the plasma and
reaction with the molecular oxygen. Since the oxygen ions could not penetrate
into the deep surface region and the molecular oxygen could not diffuse into the
bulk layer easily, the oxygen concentration of the oxygen plasma-treated PP surface
decreased with increasing take-off angle.
</p>
<p>Annealed PP, having higher crystalline fraction, had lower concentration of
atomic oxygen than quenched PP having lower crystalline fraction. The higher
degree of oxygenation of the low crystalline sample indicates a greater chemical
reactivity of the sample with plasma. It appeared that the reaction intermediates

<p>(mainly the radicals) were relatively more mobile in the polymer matrix having
lower crystalline fraction and, hence, are expected to react more easily with the
oxygen ions in the plasma [22]. Morra <i>et al</i>. have reported the influence of
crystallinity on the plasma modification of the polymer surface [5]. They concluded
that higher reactivity of the polymer, having lower crystalline fraction, was due to
greater freedom of motion granted by higher percentage of amorphous domains of
the polymer.
</p>
<p>During aging, both quenched and annealed PP samples showed similar decrease
of oxygen concentration and the change was not much in the sampling depth of
10 nm (90&#9702; take-off angle). After 30 days of aging there was 8% decrease in oxygen
concentration with quenched PP, but only 4% decrease with annealed PP in the
sampling depth of 3.4 nm (20&#9702; take-off angle). This represents, that in the surface
depth around 3.4 nm, the migration of polar functional groups of the annealed PP
is much reduced due to higher crystallinity. Increase in crystallinity hinders the
movement of the polymer chains and, therefore, slows down the aging process due
to higher structural regularity and lower free volume in the polymer matrix [8, 23].

<p>energy between the surface and its environment. Hydrophilic groups introduced
by oxygen plasma treatment oriented towards or diffused into the bulk, and the
surface became hydrophobic. In the water condition, however, the surface of oxygen
plasma-treated PP was stable, since the difference in interfacial energy was not
high. Before oxygen plasma treatment, because PP was originally hydrophobic,
the contact angle of n-octane having similar surface energy as PP was low. But the
contact angle of n-octane was high after plasma treatment and it stayed constant
during aging in the water condition. In water, the hydrophilic groups formed by
plasma treatment did not reorient towards or diffuse into the bulk. The slight
decrease of contact angle of n-octane after 1 day aging was due to dissolution of
low-molecular-weight materials (LMWM) formed by plasma treatment. The loss
of LMWM having hydrophilic groups on the surface decreased the surface energy
of PP and hence the contact angle of n-octane.
</p>
<p>From water contact angle measurements the amount of polar groups formed can
be estimated in the surface region (depth &#1;0.5 nm) after plasma treatment [24, 25].
Although the contact angles on quenched and annealed PP were almost the same
(10&#9702;) just after plasma treatment, there was more increase with less crystalline,
quenched PP during aging, as shown in Fig. 7. The increase was smaller for the
more crystalline, annealed PP and the retention of hydrophilicity was also relatively
high. The increase of contact angles after aging was interpreted as a result of
migration of polar groups away from the surface to the bulk (depth &#2;0.5 nm). The

<p>sharp increase of contact angle within 24 h was similar to the sharp decay of atomic
oxygen concentration determined from XPS in the depth of 3 nm.
</p>
<p>The fraction of immobile polar groups (<i>f</i>im) was calculated using the equation
suggested by Hyun, and the <i>f</i>im values are shown in Table 2 [11]. Chatelier
<i>et al</i>. have defined &#8216;immobile&#8217; polar groups as those that cannot participate in
polymer chain motions transporting the polar groups beyond the range of interfacial
potentials [24]. The polymer surface with a higher <i>f</i>im persisted to have a low
contact angle after long periods of aging due to the restricted polymer chain
movement in the well-ordered crystalline region. From the <i>f</i>im value of oxygen
plasma-treated PP, it was observed that the amount of immobile polar groups
(<i>f</i>im) of annealed PP was higher than those of quenched PP due to higher surface
crystallinity. These immobile polar groups with limited movement caused a low
rate of decay of oxygen containing species with more crystalline PP in the XPS
experiment. The decrease of hydrophobic recovery with the increase of crystallinity
is due to the restriction imposed on the loss of polar surface groups by the ordered
crystalline environment.
</p>
<p><i>3.4. Crosslinking after plasma treatment
</i></p>
<p>In spite of the difference in crystallinity more than 10% between annealed and
quenched PP, the more crystalline PP had only 5&#9702; lower water contact angle and
2% higher oxygen atomic concentration after 30 days aging. Also the fraction of
the immobile polar groups of more crystalline PP was not much more than that of
less crystalline PP. If the crystallinity was the only factor affecting the mobility
of polymer chains, the differences in water contact angle and oxygen atomic
concentration between quenched and annealed PP after aging would be much larger.
Therefore, we measured the gel content change after oxygen plasma treatment
(Table 3), and observed that the degree of crosslinking of less crystalline PP was
higher than that of more crystalline PP. Usually the formation of a three-dimensional
network is a well-known consequence of a polymer by inert gas plasma treatment,
and the reaction mechanisms were illustrated by Poncin-Epaillard and co-workers as
shown in Fig. 8 [27, 28]. The combination of radicals obtained after elimination of
CH3 could form the crosslinked structure. A higher degree of crosslinking formed in

<p>low crystallinity PP limited the mobility of chains and, thus, reduced the difference

</p>
<p><b>4. CONCLUSIONS
</b></p>
<p>The surface rearrangement of polypropylene (PP) having different crystallnities was
studied after oxygen plasma treatment using XPS and contact-angle measurements.
Less crystalline PP had a higher susceptibility to attack by plasma and had a higher
oxygen concentration on the surface because of the more amorphous fraction on
its surface. But during aging, the more crystalline PP had lower water contact
angle and higher oxygen concentration than the less crystalline PP. The mobility
of polar groups was reduced with increase of degree of crystallinity. After oxygen
plasma treatment, an enhancement of crosslinking was observed and the crosslinked
structure on the surface limited the reorientation and diffusion of polar functional
groups into the bulk.
