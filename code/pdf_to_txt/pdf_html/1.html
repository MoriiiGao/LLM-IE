<p>The structural organization of thermally conductive fillers with large aspect ratios in the polymer matrix is 
crucial for phonon transmission and heat transfer within polymer composites. However, how asymmetric fillers 
will response to the flow fields during melt processing especially with ultrahigh loadings is remaining unclear. In 
this work, the effects of the flow during injection molding on structural development of thermally conductive 
network in polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites were investigated. The results show that an 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composite, namely PP/FG (30/70), exhibit much higher thermal conductivity at the distal 
end than the proximal end (close to the injection gate). This discrepancy in thermal conductivity of the PP/FG 
(30/70) composite can be amplified by adding spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles with an optimum of 2.5 
wt%. The variation of thermal conductivity is attributable to the &#8220;heterogeneity&#8221; in structural organization of FG 
along the injection direction. The findings of this work provide new insight that the fountain flow during in-
jection molding could induce structural heterogeneity of FG networks within an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG com-
posites, due to the inhibited relaxation of FG orientation under a crowded packing.

<p><b>1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are of great po-
tential to replace conventional metals for tackling heat dissipation issues 
in industry, due to the lightweight, flexibility and low cost [1&#8211;5]. Over 
the past decades, TCPCs have been widely used not only in modern in-
dustry, <i>e.g</i>., heat transfer equipment, but in advanced electronics, 
including computer chips, logic circuits, <i>etc. </i>[6&#8211;11] Incorporating 
thermally conductive fillers into polymers is regarded as the most 
economical and effective strategy to prepare polymer composites with 
superior thermal conductivity [12&#8211;15]. Thermally conductive fillers are 
expected to connect and form a continuous three-dimensional (3D) 
network in the polymer matrix when the filler loading approaches to the 
so-called &#8216;percolation threshold&#8217; [16&#8211;18]. The 3D percolated network of 
thermally conductive fillers facilitates phonon transmission and heat 
transfer within TCPCs [19&#8211;21]. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated 
to fabricating 3D thermally conductive network, which is dependent of 
the filler type and size, filling ratio, filler dispersion and interfacial 
compatibility [22&#8211;24]. 
</p>
<p>The thermally conductive network of asymmetric fillers has been 
widely studied within TCPCs as the thermal conductivity of TCPCs is 
correlated with the orientation and organization of the fillers [25&#8211;27]. 
<i>Luo </i>et al. investigated the effects of magnetic aligned microstructures of 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) platelets on thermal conductivity of sil-
icone/hBN composites [26]. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
with hBN platelets oriented parallel (or perpendicular) to the heat flow 
direction is observed to be 44.5% higher (37.9% lower) than that of the 
composites with randomly oriented hBN platelets. Therefore, TCPCs 
with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained by the fine 
regulation of the orientation of asymmetric fillers [28&#8211;32]. Jia et al. 
aligned flake graphite (FG) vertically within the polymer matrix by 3D 
printing with a fused depositing mode and achieved a through-plane 
thermal conductivity (&#955;&#8869;) of 5.5 W/m&#8901;K with 50 wt% of FG [29]. 
<i>Uetani et al. prepared a type of TCPCs with only 13.2 wt% carbon fibers 
</i>but a high &#955;&#8869; of 23.3 W/m K by applying electrostatic flocking to create 
an array of vertically aligned carbon fibers [31]. Notably, the asym-
metric fillers tend to horizontally arrange along the flow field during 
melt processing (<i>e.g</i>., hot pressing, extrusion, injection molding) and the

<p>resultant polymer composites usually exhibit a high in-plane thermal 
conductivity (&#955;//) and a limited &#955;&#8869; [33&#8211;35]. In the previous work, we 
found that the addition of spherical alumina (Al2O3) microparticles into 
polypropylene/flake graphite (PP/FG) composites can effectively 
mediate the orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix during hot 
pressing and therefore increase the &#955;&#8869; of the composites [36]. 
</p>
<p>For the asymmetric fillers, most of previous work have been focusing 
on the TCPCs with moderate loadings (no more than 50 wt%) [37&#8211;40]. 
However, TCPCs in real-life applications tend to have an even higher 
filler loading for a competent thermal conductivity. Melt processing is 
the most efficient way to make TCPCs into various real-life products. To 
</p>
<p>date, it remains unclear how the flow field during melt processing could 
affect the structural organization of asymmetric fillers with an ultrahigh 
loading. In this work, PP/FG composites were chosen as the model TCPC 
system. The effect of the flow during injection molding on the orienta-
tion and organization of FG platelets (especially with an ultrahigh 
loading of 70 wt%) within the PP matrix was investigated. Due to the 
large aspect ratio, FG platelets serve as a practical &#8220;probe&#8221; detecting the 
heterogeneity of thermally conductive network in the PP matrix. The 
structure and thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were carefully 
evaluated.

<p><b>2. Experimental 
</b></p>
<p><i>2.1. Materials and sample preparation 
</i></p>
<p>Polypropylene (PP, AH561) was supplied by Sumitomo Corporation 
(Japan) with the melt flow index (MFI) of 3.0 g/10 min. Flake graphite 
(FG) was provided by Shanghai Youmo Composite Material Co., Ltd. 
(China) with an average particle size of ~23 &#956;m and a thickness of 
~0.26 &#956;m (the aspect ratio is of the order of 100). Alumina (Al2O3) 
particles with a diameter of 5 &#956;m is purchased from Ya&#8217;an Baitu High- 
tech Materials Co., Ltd (China). The PP/FG composites were prepared 
by melt blending at 190 &#9702;C, 50 rpm for 5 min, following a pre-mixing at 
20 rpm for 2 min. The strip samples were prepared by melting at 230 &#9702;C 
and injecting into a mold with a temperature of 100 &#9702;C while keeping for 
10 s at a pressure of 550 MPa. 
</p>
<p><i>2.2. Characterizations 
</i></p>
<p>The surface temperature of injection samples was recorded by an 
infrared thermograph (FLK FLUKE Ti450PRO). All samples were placed 
on a hot plate of 80 &#9702;C. The thermal conductivity of the samples was 
measured by a Nano Laser Flash Apparatus (LFA447, NETZSCH). Each 
sample was measured for 3 times and the average thermal conductivity 
was calculated. The weight fraction of FG platelets at different positions 
of the injection samples was measured by a thermal gravimetric analyzer 
(TGA, TA-Q500). The samples were heated from 30 &#9702;C to 650 &#9702;C in a N2 
atmosphere at a rate of 10 &#9702;C/min. The crystallinity of the samples at 
different positions was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
TA-Q2000) in a N2 atmosphere. The samples were first heated to 220 &#9702;C 
with 10 &#9702;C/min from 30 &#9702;C and held isothermally for 5 min to eliminate 
thermal history. Then, the samples were cooled to 30 &#9702;C at a heating rate 
of 10 &#9702;C/min, followed by heating again to 220 &#9702;C.

<p>The morphology of the cross section of the injected samples was 
inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The 
samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried in a 55 &#9702;C oven for 4 
h. The fracture surface was coated with a thin layer of gold by spraying 
before SEM observation. The evaluation of FG orientation within PP 
matrix across the whole thickness of samples was carried out by small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at beamline of BL16B1 (Shanghai Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility, SSRF). The wavelength of X-ray is 0.124 
nm, and the sample-detector distance is 1980 mm. The scattering signals 
are collected by the detector (Pilatus3 2M). The degree of FG orientation 
at the cross-section of PP/FG samples was evaluated using a wide-angle 
X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, Bruker-D8). The wavelength of Cu-K&#945; ra-
diation filtered by Ni is 1.54 &#197;. The working voltage and current were 
40 kV, and 30 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is set 5 o/min, and 
the scanning range is 5&#8211;50 o. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Results 
</b></p>
<p>To investigate the effects of injection flow on the structural organi-
zation of asymmetric fillers in a polymer matrix, especially with ultra-
high filler loadings, PP/FG composites with 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt 
% of FG platelets were prepared by injection molding (Fig. 1). The 
samples are denoted PP/FG (70/30), PP/FG (50/50), and PP/FG (30/ 
70). Fig. 1a shows the injection mold and optical macrograph of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample. The spline is 8 cm in length, 1 cm in 
width and 0.4 cm in thickness. Fig. 1b illustrates the proximal and distal 
ends of an injected sample for measuring the through-plane thermal 
conductivity (&#955;&#8869;), which is perpendicular to the injection flow direction. 
</p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of PP/FG composites were first evaluated 
by measuring the time-dependent surface temperature of the injected 
samples placed on a hot plate with a temperature of 80 &#9702;C. Fig. 2a&#8211;d 
shows the real-time infrared images revealing the variation of surface 
temperature of the injected PP/FG samples. The temperature change of 
the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG samples with time was plotted in

<p>Fig. 2e. The rate of temperature rise is accelerated with the increasing of 
the FG loadings. It is notable that the PP/FG (30/70) sample shows a 
much faster temperature rise at the distal (solid triangles) end than the 
proximal end (hollow triangles). This discrepancy becomes insignificant 
in PP/FG samples with a lower FG loading, <i>i.e</i>., 50 wt%, 30 wt%. The <i>&#955;</i>&#8869;
of PP/FG composites was then measured at the proximal and distal 
positions (Fig. 2f). Both <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; at the proximal and distal ends of PP/FG 
composites increased with the FG loadings. A position-dependent <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; (the 
distal end: 6.81 W/m&#8901;K; and the proximal end: 5.54 W/m&#8901;K) was 
observed in the PP/FG (30/70) sample. 
</p>
<p>As the uneven distribution of FG platelets and/or different crystal-
lization behaviors of the PP matrix may contribute to the discrepancy in 
thermal conductivity between the proximal and distal ends [41,42], the 
weight fraction of FG and the crystallization of PP at the proximal and 
distal positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample were analyzed. 
Fig. 3a shows TGA curves of the proximal and distal positions of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample, respectively. However, no significant 
difference in residual weight of the composite was observed between the 
proximal and distal ends. The crystallization behaviors of PP at the 
proximal and distal positions were then characterized. Fig. 3b shows 
DSC endotherms of the samples from the proximal and distal ends of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) samples. No distinct changes in melting tem-
perature (<i>T</i>m) and crystallinity (<i>X</i>c) of PP can be discerned (the proximal 
end: <i>T</i>m = 166.4 &#9702;C, <i>X</i>c = 29.6%; the distal end: <i>T</i>m = 166.9 &#9702;C, <i>X</i>c =
</p>
<p>28.5%, see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). Moreover, no difference in 
crystal modifications was observed between the proximal and distal 
positions of an injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (see Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Data). Thus, the effects of uneven distribution of FG platelets 
and crystallization of PP matrix can be excluded. 
</p>
<p>To explore the correlation between the discrepancy of <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; and the 
</p>
<p>heterogeneity of structural organization, the formation of FG networks 
and orientation of FG platelets at different positions of injected PP/FG 
samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b shows the cross-sections of the 
proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG (70/30) sample, respectively. 
As a content of 30 wt% is well below the percolation threshold (see 
Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data), the FG network cannot be distinguished. 
In contrast, the percolation network of FG platelets can be clearly seen 
both in the samples from the proximal and distal positions of a PP/FG 
(30/70) sample (Fig. 4d and e). The degree of FG orientation at the 
cross-sections of the samples from the proximal and distal positions was 
then evaluated by WAXD measurements (Fig. 4c, f). The characteristic 
diffraction peak at 2<i>&#952; </i>= 26.5&#9702; is assigned to the (002) plane of FG 
stacking [43]. The intensity between the cross-sections of the proximal 
and distal positions of the PP/FG (70/30) sample is neglectable (Fig. 4c). 
However, the relative change of intensity between the proximal and 
distal positions of the PP/FG (30/70) sample is 219% (Fig. 4f). The re-
sults imply that structural heterogeneity may account for the 
position-dependent thermal conductivity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG 
(30/70) composites. 
</p>
<p>To further verify the correlation between the discrepancy in <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; and 
structural heterogeneity of the PP/FG (30/70) samples after injection 
molding, SAXS measurements were carried out at the proximal, middle, 
and distal positions to evaluate the overall orientation of FG within the 
PP matrix (Fig. 5). The anisotropic 2D scattering patterns imply the 
orientation of FG platelets within the PP matrix. To evaluate the degree 
of FG orientation, <i>L</i>1/<i>L</i>2, the ratio between the long and short axes of the 
ellipse-like scattering patterns was calculated. The higher value of <i>L</i>1/<i>L</i>2, 
the higher degree of FG orientation. For the PP/FG (70/30) samples, no 
significant changes of L1/L2 at different positions were observed. A slight 
decrease of <i>L</i>1/<i>L</i>2 from 1.37 to 1.26 was observed in a 50/50 sample.

<p>Notably, the value of <i>L</i>1/<i>L</i>2 decrease from 1.44 at the proximal end to 
1.06 at the distal end of a 30/70 sample remarkably. In other words, the 
degree of FG orientation within PP/FG (30/70) composites decreases 
along the injection flow direction. The results indicate that the injection 
</p>
<p>flow could mediate the structural organization of FG platelets within the 
PP matrix (and &#955;&#8869;) of an ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composite. 
</p>
<p>In previous work, we observed that the addition of spherical Al2O3 
microparticles can mediate the orientation of FG platelets and improve 
the <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; of PP/FG composites prepared by hot pressing [35]. To further 
explore how spherical Al2O3 microparticles will affect the orientation of 
FG platelets under the flow field during injection molding, PP/FG/Al2O3 
composites with varying Al2O3 contents were prepared. Fig. 6a&#8211;d shows 
the real-time infrared images indicating the surface temperature of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites. Coincidentally, the discrepancy of tempera-
ture rise can be easily distinguished between the proximal and distal 
ends, as like PP/FG composites (Fig. 6e). Both the <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; of PP/FG/Al2O3 at 
the proximal and distal positions are observed to decrease when the 
Al2O3 content exceeds 2.5 wt% (Fig. 6f). This is a result of the &#8220;dilution&#8221; 
effect caused by replacing FG platelets with the less thermally conduc-
tive Al2O3 microparticles (especially with high contents). Notably, the 
difference of <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; between the proximal and distal position (&#916;<i>&#955;</i>&#8869;/<i>&#955;</i>&#8869;) of 
PP/FG/Al2O3 composites where 2.5 wt% FG platelets was replaced with 
Al2O3 microparticles is higher than that of PP/FG (30/70) composites. 
The &#916;<i>&#955;</i>&#8869;/<i>&#955;</i>&#8869; values of PP/FG/Al2O3 (30/67.5/2.5) and PP/FG (30/70) 
composites are 0.29 and 0.23, respectively. As reported in our previous 
work, a small amount of spherical Al2O3 microparticles will &#8220;disturb&#8221; 
the interlayer orientation and stacking of FG platelets (reducing the 
degree of FG orientation along the flow direction during hot pressing) 
and therefore improve the <i>&#955;</i>&#8869; of PP/FG composites [35]. The result in 
this work indicates that the injection flow and spherical Al2O3 micro-
particles can synergistically contribute to the development of structural 
heterogeneity of PP/FG composites.

<p>In this work, we report an unusual structural development of 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG composites during injection molding. We believe 
that the structural heterogeneity of PP/FG composites is not only related 
to the fountain flow during the first (injecting) stage of injection 
molding, but the ultrahigh filler loading that will inhibit the relaxation 
of polymer melt during the second (pack-and-hold) stage. The fountain 
flow is commonly observed in thermoplastics during injection molding 
[44&#8211;48]. When a polymer melt enters a mold under shear and exten-
sional flows, the part of melt at the advancing front decelerates and 
acquires a transverse velocity, spilling outward toward the mold wall 
[45]. The flow inside the mold mimics a water fountain. For a &#8220;cold&#8221; 
mold during non-isothermal injection, the fountain flow becomes more 
pronounceable due to the solidification of polymer melt at the mold wall 
[45,47]. 
</p>
<p>During the filling (injecting) stage, the melt of polymer composites 
flows into the mold and quickly &#8220;freezes&#8221; when gets into contact with 
the cold wall, creating a frozen layer (illustrated as the grey part in 
Fig. 7a). The incoming melt will continue to move ahead of the frozen 
layer meeting the mold wall in the front and continue to form a frozen 
layer until the mold is almost filled (Fig. 7b). The frozen layer at the 
proximal position is getting thicker and the channel of the mold is get-
ting thinner. The flow mechanics is correlated to the viscoelastic be-
haviors of the polymer melt. We found that the incorporation of FG 
platelets did not affect the shear thinning behaviors of the polymer 
matrix (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data). Therefore, the fountain flow is 
essential for directing the orientation of FG platelets within PP/FG 
composites. 
</p>
<p>During the pack-and-hold stage, the relaxation of the melt of the 
composites will lead to the loss of orientation of FG platelets directed by 
fountain flow, when the FG loading is low. In contrast, in an ultrahigh- 
filled PP/FG (30/70) composite, we believe that the crowded packing of 
FG platelets will inhibit the relaxation of the melt and therefore main-
tain the fountain flow-induced structural heterogeneity. To have a better 
understanding of the variation of FG orientation, we carefully measured 
the position-dependent surface temperature changes of the injected PP/

<p>FG samples (Fig. 8). Here, we sandwiched a thin layer of FG between the 
sample and the hot stage to get an optimum contact and a competent 
heating efficacy. 
</p>
<p>The surface temperature varies slightly within the distance of around 
3 cm and increase significantly from the position of 3 cm&#8211;8 cm of an 
injected PP/FG (30/70) sample (Fig. 8). The results may indicate that 
the orientation of FG platelets does not change significantly at the 
proximal end until it reaches a specific length. It is interesting but still 
unknown whether this specific length is related to injection conditions 
(<i>e.g</i>., injection pressure, mold temperature, <i>etc.</i>) and/or geometry of 
injection mold. Continuing work will be carried out in the future.

<p><b>5. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>In this work, we investigated the structural development of ther-
mally conductive polymer composites with asymmetric fillers during 
injection molding using PP/FG composites as the model system. The 
results showed that the PP/FG (30/70) composites with an ultrahigh 
filler loading exhibited different thermal conductivity values along the 
injection direction. The variation of thermal conductivity was related to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
PP matrix. The fountain flow during injection molding and the crowded 
effect imposed by ultrahigh filler loading synergistically contributed to 
the development of structural heterogeneity of FG network within the 
ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) composites. The fountain flow directed 
the orientation of FG platelets and contributed to the development of 
structural heterogeneity within PP/FG composites. The ultrahigh filling 
created a crowded packing of FG platelets and inhibited the relaxation of 
the melt of the composites. Therefore, the fountain flow-induced 
structural heterogeneity of the ultrahigh-filled PP/FG (30/70) compos-
ite was maintained. This work provides new insights into structural 
developments of asymmetric fillers with ultrahigh filling loadings within 
the polymer matrix during injection molding.
