<p>Abstract
</p>
<p>Three nearly identical linear low density polyethylene resins based on copolymers of ethylene with 1-butene (B), 1-hexene (H) and
</p>
<p>1-octene (O) were utilized to investigate the effect of short chain branch length on the mechanical properties of blown and compression
</p>
<p>molded (quenched and slow cooled) films. The content of short chain comononer in the three copolymers was ca. 2.5&#8211;2.9 mol% that
</p>
<p>corresponded to a density of 0.917&#8211;0.918 g/cm3. Within a given series, the tensile properties of these films do not show any significant
</p>
<p>difference at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min), even though the DSC and TREF profiles of &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; differed slightly in
</p>
<p>comparison to &#8216;B&#8217;. However, at higher deformation rates (ca. 1 m/s), the breaking strength of these films was found to increase with
</p>
<p>increasing short chain branch length. In addition, the Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength of the blown films were also observed to
</p>
<p>increase with increasing short chain branch length. Further, dart impact strength and high-speed puncture resistance (5.1 m/s) of 1-octene and
</p>
<p>1-hexene based samples was also observed to be higher than that based on 1-butene. The blown films displayed low and comparable levels of
</p>
<p>equivalent in-plane birefringence and crystalline orientation by wide angle X-ray scattering. This confirms that the differences in mechanical
</p>
<p>properties in the blown film series are not attributable to differences in molecular orientation. The deformation behavior of both the
</p>
<p>compression molded and blown films were also investigated in a well-defined controlled regime by analyzing their essential work of fracture.
</p>
<p>It was found that the essential work of fracture of films based on 1-hexene and 1-octene was higher than that of films based on 1-butene. While
</p>
<p>the origin of these differences in mechanical properties with increasing short chain branch length is not fully understood, the present
</p>
<p>investigation confirms this effect to be pronounced at high deformation rates for both the blown and compression molded quenched films.

</p>
<p>attempted to address this same topic but in doing so, many
</p>
<p>important and influential parameterswere not necessarily well
</p>
<p>controlled in the respective investigations. We believe the
</p>
<p>present report has improved on this aspect aswill be discussed.
</p>
<p>LLDPE resins are typically produced using Ziegler Natta
</p>
<p>heterogeneous catalysts, whose origins can be traced back to
</p>
<p>the late 1950s [1]. However, the resins produced by these
</p>
<p>catalysts are characterized by considerable heterogeneity in
</p>
<p>their microstructure and melting behavior and are con-
</p>
<p>sidered to be a mixture of fractions of polyethylene
</p>
<p>copolymers with a range of molecular weights and short
</p>
<p>chain branch content. In the mid 1990s, with the commercial
</p>
<p>advent of high efficiency single site metallocene catalysts,
</p>
<p>narrow molecular weight distribution LLDPEs with con-
</p>
<p>siderably more homogenous distribution of short chain
</p>
<p>branches were produced. Metallocene-based LLDPE resins
</p>
<p>have now been commercialized using various different
</p>
<p>catalyst technologies [2&#8211;6]. The single site metallocene
</p>
<p>catalysts produce copolymers that have much narrower
</p>
<p>molecular weight distributions (ca. 2&#8211;3) and a greater
</p>
<p>uniformity in the distribution of the short chain branching
</p>
<p>across the width of the molecular weight distribution
</p>
<p>relative to the Ziegler Natta catalyzed systems.
</p>
<p>LLDPE resins of all types constitute a major segment of
</p>
<p>the polyethylene (PE) blown film market worldwide. It is
</p>
<p>known that the mechanical properties of the LLDPE films
</p>
<p>are influenced by molecular structural parameters such as
</p>
<p>molecular weight, molecular weight distribution in addition
</p>
<p>to the amount as well as the short chain branch distribution
</p>
<p>(SCBD) across the width of the copolymer molecular
</p>
<p>weight distribution. Morphological features such as degree
</p>
<p>of crystallinity, intercrystalline connectivity and preferred
</p>
<p>orientation are also strongly believed to have an effect of the
</p>
<p>mechanical properties of blown LLDPE films [7&#8211;19].
</p>
<p>Short chain branching critically affects the crystallinity
</p>
<p>and thus the morphology and consequently the solid-state
</p>
<p>properties of the corresponding LLDPE films. As a result, a
</p>
<p>broad range of properties of LLDPEs can be obtained by
</p>
<p>varying the amount of SCB and the SCBD. In addition, the
</p>
<p>length of the short chain branch may also play an important
</p>
<p>role in governing the mechanical properties&#8212;the specific
</p>
<p>issue that will be addressed in this study. Early on, Cady
</p>
<p>[20] investigated the effects of the type of short chain
</p>
<p>branching (SCB) and SCBD on the dart impact and
</p>
<p>Elmendorf tear strength of blown films of LLDPEs based
</p>
<p>on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene that were synthesized
</p>
<p>using Zeigler Natta catalyst chemistry. For similar density
</p>
<p>and melt flow index, the 1-butene based resins performed
</p>
<p>poorly in comparison to those based on 1-hexene and
</p>
<p>1-octene, even though it had a more homogenous SCBD.
</p>
<p>However, comparison of two different 1-octene based resins
</p>
<p>that differed in their SCBD indicated better mechanical
</p>
<p>performance for the 1-octene based resin that had a more
</p>
<p>homogenous SCBD. No comment was made on the relative
</p>
<p>amounts of the short chain branching in each of the resins, %</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>crystallinity or orientation of the blown films. However, it
</p>
<p>was concluded that the combination of the short chain
</p>
<p>branch length and a more homogenous SCBD leads to better
</p>
<p>mechanical properties of LLDPE blown films. In a similar
</p>
<p>study utilizing LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene
</p>
<p>and 1-octene that had densities in the range of 0.919&#8211;
</p>
<p>0.921 g/cm3, melt flow indices of 0.9&#8211;1 dg/min and
</p>
<p>polydispersities of 3.3&#8211;4.1, Liu and Baker [21] observed
</p>
<p>the impact strength to increase with increasing short chain
</p>
<p>branch length. It was suggested that the longer short chain
</p>
<p>branches lead to a larger fraction of tie molecules in the
</p>
<p>interlamellar region that causes the observed increase in
</p>
<p>impact strength. However, in this study as well, both the
</p>
<p>comonomer content and the SCBD varied simultaneously,
</p>
<p>thereby making the interpretation of the corresponding
</p>
<p>effects uncertain. In a third study, Kim and Park [22] observed
</p>
<p>a similar trend for Zeigler-Natta catalyzed 1-butene, 1-hexene
</p>
<p>and 1-octene based LLDPE blown films that had relatively
</p>
<p>larger polydispersities (w6), varying comonomer compo-
</p>
<p>sition (4.3, 3.7 and 2.8 mol% of 1-butene, 1-hexene and
</p>
<p>1-octene, respectively) and varying branch density (21, 17 and
</p>
<p>13 CH3/1000 C for 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene based
</p>
<p>resins, respectively). The differences in the dart impact and
</p>
<p>Elmendorf tear strengths of the blown films based on the three
</p>
<p>resins were attributed to the differences in short chain
</p>
<p>branching distributions and increased imperfections in the
</p>
<p>crystallographic order and decreased lamellar thickness
</p>
<p>with increasing short chain branch length.
</p>
<p>Wolfe [23] studied the effect of comonomer type on the
</p>
<p>slow crack growth resistance of high-density polyethylene
</p>
<p>using the PENT (ASTM F1473) test. Of the two
</p>
<p>comonomers investigated (&#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;H&#8217;), the HDPE based
</p>
<p>on 1-hexene failed after 400 h compared to 30 h in the case
</p>
<p>of HDPE based on 1-butene. No comment, however, was
</p>
<p>made on the molecular weight, distribution of the short
</p>
<p>chain branches and orientation of molecular chains in the
</p>
<p>pipe resins utilized.
</p>
<p>By investigating LLDPE resins based on 1-butene and
</p>
<p>1-octene, Kale et al. [24] compared the intrinsic tear
</p>
<p>strengths for two sets of resins (each set had two resins
</p>
<p>based each on 1-butene and 1-octene) of densities 0.912 and
</p>
<p>0.921 g/cm3, respectively. The resins had similar poly-
</p>
<p>dispersities (2.12&#8211;2.25), melt flow indices (0.93&#8211;1.02) but
</p>
<p>different short chain branch comonomer content. For the
</p>
<p>0.912 g/cm3 set of resins, the mol% of 1-butene was 4.17
</p>
<p>and that of 1-octene was 3.04; for the 0.921 g/cm3 set of
</p>
<p>resins, these were 3.04 and 1.77 mol%, respectively, for
</p>
<p>1-butene and 1-octene. Despite the differences in their
</p>
<p>comonomer content and the lack of information on the
</p>
<p>SCBD, the higher intrinsic tear strength of the 1-octene
</p>
<p>based LLDPE resins relative to the 1-butene based resins
</p>
<p>was speculated to be due to enhanced tie molecule
</p>
<p>formation with increasing short chain branch length.
</p>
<p>Further, the observed difference in the melting point versus
</p>
<p>mole fraction comonomer relationships for 1-butene and
</p>
<p>1-octene based LLDPE resins was suggested to be due to the</p>

</div><div><p>incorporation of small amounts of 1-butene into the
</p>
<p>crystalline phase and/or variations in the commoner
</p>
<p>sequence distributions. However, Alizadeh et al. [25] and
</p>
<p>Alamo et al. [26] have shown that the melting point
</p>
<p>depression with increasing mole fraction of the short chain
</p>
<p>branch comonomer is independent of the type of the
</p>
<p>comonomer, i.e. at any given mole fraction of 1-butene,
</p>
<p>1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene in metallocene catalyzed
</p>
<p>copolymers with polyethylene, the melting point depression
</p>
<p>of all these copolymers was observed to be comparable.
</p>
<p>Further, Alizadeh et al. [25] observed that at any given
</p>
<p>mol% of the short chain branch comonomer, the degree of
</p>
<p>crystallinity was also very comparable for LLDPE based on
</p>
<p>1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. These obser-
</p>
<p>vations clearly suggest that the degree/probability of branch
</p>
<p>exclusion from the lamellar crystal is independent of the
</p>
<p>comonomer type, viz. 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in turn, one would expect no differences in tie
</p>
<p>molecule formation for the three LLDPE materials based on
</p>
<p>1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.
</p>
<p>Kennedy et al. [27] also studied the tensile stress&#8211;strain
</p>
<p>behavior of metallocene catalyzed LLDPE resins based on
</p>
<p>1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-methyl-1-pentene. It
</p>
<p>was observed that the nominal-stress strain curves, that were
</p>
<p>measured at low deformation rate of 0.0004 m/s (1 in./min)
</p>
<p>compared to high deformation rates involved during the
</p>
<p>impact (0.2&#8211;4 m/s) and Elmendorf tear testing (0.1&#8211;7 m/s),
</p>
<p>were dominated by strain hardening for all the LLDPEs
</p>
<p>resins excepting those based on 1-butene. The yield stress
</p>
<p>and initial modulus were related to the degree of crystal-
</p>
<p>linity regardless of the short chain branch comonomer.
</p>
<p>More importantly, for the highest molecular weights studied
</p>
<p>(MwO100,000 g/mol) the force-elongation curves
</p>
<p>(recorded at low deformation rates of 0.0004 m/s) for the
</p>
<p>four resins were observed to be similar to one another for the
</p>
<p>same short chain branch content. This last observation is
</p>
<p>important for until the present report, the tensile stress strain
</p>
<p>behavior of LLDPE resins, particularly based on 1-butene,
</p>
<p>1-hexene or 1-octene, have not been systematically studied
</p>
<p>at high deformation rates similar to those involved in dart or
</p>
<p>Spencer impact and Elmendorf tear strength testing. In
</p>
<p>addition, the dart or Spencer impact strength and Elmendorf
</p>
<p>tear resistance measurements, although standard ASTM
</p>
<p>measurements in industry are characterized by non-uniform
</p>
<p>deformation rates.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that most of the studies that relate
</p>
<p>to the influence exerted by the branch length involve
</p>
<p>comparisons of LLDPE films from resins that either have
</p>
<p>different short chain branch contents, different comonomer
</p>
<p>distribution profile (SCBD), different polydispersities or
</p>
<p>different short chain branch density on the main ethylene
</p>
<p>backbone. As a result, it is extremely difficult to properly
</p>
<p>interpret the results and separate the effects of the individual
</p>
<p>parameters (mentioned above) on the physical properties of
</p>
<p>LLDPE resins due to their simultaneous variation. Thus, in
</p>
<p>this study, three LLDPE resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>and 1-octene, that have been carefully synthesized [28]
</p>
<p>using the same single site metallocene based catalyst, were
</p>
<p>examined to specifically investigate the effect of the
</p>
<p>comonomer type (short chain branch length), viz.
</p>
<p>1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene on the mechanical proper-
</p>
<p>ties of blown and compression molded LLDPE films. As
</p>
<p>will be discussed later, these three resins were very
</p>
<p>comparable in terms of their molecular, rheological,
</p>
<p>comonomer content and SCBD aspects. As a result, any
</p>
<p>differences arising out of structural differences from other
</p>
<p>origins, while not fully eliminated, were minimized. Results
</p>
<p>from the earlier study [28] showed that while the tensile
</p>
<p>properties, at nominal deformation rates, of the blown films
</p>
<p>were indistinguishable, the Elmendorf tear, dart impact and
</p>
<p>Spencer impact properties of the 1-butene based films were
</p>
<p>significantly lower than the corresponding 1-hexene and
</p>
<p>1-octene based films. The difference between 1-hexene and
</p>
<p>1-octene films was much smaller with a slight advantage for
</p>
<p>the 1-octene films. In this study, we attempt to further
</p>
<p>investigate the effect of the type of the short chain branch on
</p>
<p>the mechanical properties of LLDPE films since other
</p>
<p>parameters (like comonomer content, SCBD, molecular
</p>
<p>weight, molecular weight distribution, polydispersity and
</p>
<p>density) were established to be essentially constant [28].
</p>
<p>The mechanical properties were measured utilizing Spencer
</p>
<p>impact, Elmendorf tear resistance and high-speed puncture
</p>
<p>resistance measurements as well as in a controlled tensile
</p>
<p>deformation regime by utilizing the essential work of
</p>
<p>fracture methodology/technique.</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>2. Essential work of fracture (EWF)
</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that the EWF procedure is
</p>
<p>a very useful method to study the fracture properties of thin
</p>
<p>films and ductile materials [29&#8211;33]. The concept of EWF
</p>
<p>was developed initially by Cotterell and Reddel [34] on the
</p>
<p>basis of ideas proposed by Broberg [35], who suggested that
</p>
<p>the total work of fracture (Wf) dissipated in a precracked
</p>
<p>specimen could be represented as a sum of the work
</p>
<p>consumed into two distinct zones. As shown in Fig. 1, the
</p>
<p>double-edge-notched-tension (DENT) specimen that is
</p>
<p>precracked along the horizontal (inwards from the vertical
</p>
<p>edges) to leave a ligament region &#8216;l&#8217; that undergoes the actual
</p>
<p>deformation in tension under a load &#8216;F&#8217; along the vertical.
</p>
<p>The regions marked as &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;2&#8217; depict the fracture process
</p>
<p>zone (FPZ) and the outer plastic zone, respectively, (OPZ).
</p>
<p>The work dissipated in the FPZ corresponds to the
</p>
<p>essential work of fracture (We); and the work required to
</p>
<p>yield the material in the OPZ is the non-essential work of
</p>
<p>fracture (Wp) that depends on the geometry of the specimen
</p>
<p>tested. Thus, the total fracture energy is expressed as (more

<p>evaluating the Wf for each specimen (area under the
</p>
<p>force&#8211;displacement curve) followed by suitable normal-
</p>
<p>ization with respect to the ligament area to give a plot of wf
</p>
<p>vs. l. The best-fit regression line would then give the slope
</p>
<p>(bwp) and intercept (we).
</p>
<p>When plane stress conditions prevail for all ligament
</p>
<p>lengths, it is assumed [36] that we is a material property (a
</p>
<p>constant) at a given thickness. Mathematically, for plane
</p>
<p>stress conditions, the following two relationships should be
</p>
<p>satisfied:
</p>
<p>lR &#240;3w5&#222;t (3)
</p>
<p>t/25
we
</p>
<p>sy
(4)
</p>
<p>Under these conditions, it has been demonstrated theoreti-
</p>
<p>cally [37] and supported experimentally [37&#8211;39] that we is
</p>
<p>equivalent to Jc, or the J-integral. For a nonlinear elastic
</p>
<p>body containing a precrack and undergoing deformation, Jc
represents the strain energy release rate of nonlinear elastic</p>

</div><div><p>materials and is given by: [40]
</p>
<p>JC ZK
dU
</p>
<p>dA
(5)
</p>
<p>where U is the potential energy (also the difference between
</p>
<p>the strain energy stored in the body and the work done by
</p>
<p>external forces of deformation) and A is the crack area. It
</p>
<p>can be seen that the units of Jc are also energy/area (the
</p>
<p>same as we). Thus, the advantage of the EWF method is its
</p>
<p>experimental simplicity as compared to the J-integral
</p>
<p>procedure.</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>3. Experimental
</p>
<p>3.1. Material synthesis
</p>
<p>The three LLDPE copolymers (based on ethylene-co-1-
</p>
<p>butene, &#8216;B&#8217;, ethylene-co-1-hexene, &#8216;H&#8217;, and ethylene-co-1-
</p>
<p>octene, &#8216;O&#8217;) used in this study were synthesized by using a
</p>
<p>Chevron Phillips&#8217; proprietary zirconium based metallocene
</p>
<p>catalyst [28]. The copolymerization was conducted in a pilot
</p>
<p>plant at Chevron Phillips under steady state slurry-loop
</p>
<p>copolymerization conditions. The comonomers and the
</p>
<p>catalyst were fed continuously and the polymer fluff was
</p>
<p>continuously removed from the reactor. The fluff was
</p>
<p>purged with nitrogen to remove residual solvent and
</p>
<p>unreacted olefins followed by blending with antioxidants
</p>
<p>and a processing aid. The polymers were then extruded into
</p>
<p>pellets.
</p>
<p>3.2. Characterization of the resins
</p>
<p>The molecular, rheological and branching characteristics
</p>
<p>of the three resins are listed in Table 1. The rheological data
</p>
<p>were obtained using a Rheometrics Scientific Inc., ARES
</p>
<p>rheometer. Small strain (10%) oscillatory measurements
</p>
<p>across a frequency range of 0.03&#8211;95 rad/s were made at
</p>
<p>190 8C under a nitrogen blanket. The resulting complex
</p>
<p>viscosity versus frequency data was fitted using the modi-
</p>
<p>fied Carreau&#8211;Yasuda (CY) empirical model [41,42] to
</p>
<p>obtain the zero shear viscosity (h0). The molecular weight,</p>

</div><div><p>and the molecular weight distribution were determined by
</p>
<p>gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Nuclear magnetic
</p>
<p>resonance (NMR) was utilized to determine the amount of
</p>
<p>comonomer and thus the short chain branching incorporated
</p>
<p>into the respective copolymers. The experimental proce-
</p>
<p>dures of these two techniques are outlined in detail else-
</p>
<p>where [43]. In addition, the comonomer composition
</p>
<p>distribution across the molecular weight distribution of
</p>
<p>these three copolymers was determined by a recently deve-
</p>
<p>loped chemometric technique [44] based on size exclusion
</p>
<p>chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectros-
</p>
<p>copy (SEC&#8211;FTIR).
</p>
<p>Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) was
</p>
<p>performed on the three resins to determine the homogeneity
</p>
<p>of incorporation of SCB in the copolymers. This was done
</p>
<p>by using a triple detector TREF instrument which was
</p>
<p>assembled using parts retro-fitted into a Waters 150C GPC
</p>
<p>system. The column (12.55 mm ID and 150 mm in length)
</p>
<p>was packed with #30 stainless steel shot (Vulcan Blast Shot
</p>
<p>Technology, Brantfor, Ont., Canada). The oven heater pro-
</p>
<p>vided programmed cooling and heating in the 35&#8211;150 8C
</p>
<p>range. It was controlled externally via West 4400 set point
</p>
<p>programmer. Three detectors, viz. a Foxboro infrared (IR)
</p>
<p>(3.4 nm), a Viscotek 150R viscometer and a PDI 15 and
</p>
<p>90-degree dual-angle light scattering detector, were utilized
</p>
<p>for characterization. The viscometer and the light scattering
</p>
<p>detector were housed in the same oven while the IR cell was
</p>
<p>heated separately. Sample solutions were prepared in the
</p>
<p>carrier solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), at 3 mg/mL.
</p>
<p>In the experiment, 500 mL of the sample solution was
</p>
<p>injected onto the column at 150 8C and subsequently cooled
</p>
<p>to 35 8C at a rate of 0.72 8C/min, to allow slow and complete
</p>
<p>crystallization. The column was then slowly re-heated to
</p>
<p>150 8C at a rate of 1.5 8C/min with a solvent flow rate
</p>
<p>of 0.5 mL/min, during which the polymer molecules
</p>
<p>re-dissolved and eluted out into the three detectors. Analysis
</p>
<p>of the data obtained from the IR detector was done to get
</p>
<p>normalized weight fraction of the fractionated copolymer as
</p>
<p>a function of the temperature.
</p>
<p>3.3. Film preparation
</p>
<p>Blown films were made from each of the three resins
</p>
<p>under the following conditions: 100 mm (4 in.) die diameter,
</p>
<p>1.5 mm die gap, 37.5 mm diameter single-screw extruder
</p>
<p>(L/DZ24, compression ratio 2.2:1), 115 rpm screw speed (ca.
</p>
<p>27 kg/h output rate), 2.5:1 blow up ratio (BUR) and barrel and
</p>
<p>die temperatures set to 190 8C. The freeze line height (FLH)
</p>
<p>was between 20 and 28 cm and cooling was accomplished
</p>
<p>with a dual lip air ring using ambient air that had a temperature
</p>
<p>of ca. 20 8C. Films with different thicknesses (12.5&#8211;100 mm
or 0.5&#8211;4 mil) were produced this way. These conditions are
</p>
<p>representative of typical commercial scale LLDPE blown
</p>
<p>film processing according to scaling procedures established
</p>
<p>previously [45].
</p>
<p>In addition to these blown films, unoriented quenched</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>and slow cooled compression molded films were also pro-
</p>
<p>duced. Preweighed amounts of the copolymer pellets were
</p>
<p>melted in a mold at 150 8C for 10 min followed by the
</p>
<p>application of 3000 lb f (ca. 1350 kg f) for 5 min. Quenched
</p>
<p>(Q) samples were prepared by being removed from the
</p>
<p>heater plates followed by being placed on a wooden labora-
</p>
<p>tory bench and exposed to ambient conditions. The samples
</p>
<p>took ca. 5 min to cool to ambient temperature (ca. 20 8C).
</p>
<p>For the slow cooled (SC) samples, the mold containing the
</p>
<p>molten film was allowed to remain between the heater plates
</p>
<p>after the pressure was released. The power to the heater
</p>
<p>plates was then turned off to allow slow cooling of the films.
</p>
<p>The samples attained room temperature in ca. 8 h. Both the
</p>
<p>Q and SC films were ca. 125 mm (5 mil) in thickness.
</p>
<p>3.4. Film characterization
</p>
<p>The blown films of different thicknesses were tested for
</p>
<p>their dart impact strength, Spencer impact strength and
</p>
<p>Elmendorf tear resistance according to ASTM D-1709
</p>
<p>(method A), ASTM D-3420 (although a special in-house
</p>
<p>pendulum was utilized to ensure failures) and ASTM
</p>
<p>D-1922 standards, respectively, at ambient conditions. In
</p>
<p>addition, high-speed puncture resistance of the LLDPE
</p>
<p>copolymers, at a high impact velocity (5.1 m/s), was also
</p>
<p>investigated. For this test, quenched compression molded
</p>
<p>and slow cooled plaques of approximately 3.35 mm
</p>
<p>thickness were employed. The compression molded speci-
</p>
<p>mens (corresponding to &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;) were clamped in a
</p>
<p>circular fixture that is 76 mm in diameter. A 23.76 kg mass
</p>
<p>tup/dart (13 mm diameter hemispherical end) was dropped
</p>
<p>on the clamped specimens at an impact velocity of 5.1 m/s
</p>
<p>(corresponding to a drop height of 1 m). The direction of
</p>
<p>impact was parallel to the specimen thickness, and the point
</p>
<p>of impact was at the center of the clamped specimen. The
</p>
<p>tup/dart was equipped with a load sensor to measure the load
</p>
<p>response as a function of time, during the impact event. A
</p>
<p>separate photo sensor provided a measurement of the initial
</p>
<p>impact velocity. At a given weight of the tup/dart assembly
</p>
<p>and its impact velocity, the specimen load-deflection data
</p>
<p>for the impact event was recorded. Total energy (J) to
</p>
<p>rupture as measured from the load-deflection curve was
</p>
<p>used to characterize the impact performance. The quantities
</p>
<p>(energy to rupture) measured from this test are not fixed
</p>
<p>material properties as they depend on the test specimen size
</p>
<p>(thickness) and the specific test conditions.
</p>
<p>Blown films that were 25 mm in thickness (each from
</p>
<p>resins based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) in
</p>
<p>addition to the compression molded films were chosen for
</p>
<p>the rest of the characterization methods utilized including
</p>
<p>refractive index measurements, differential scanning calori-
</p>
<p>metry (DSC) and essential work of fracture analysis. Flat
</p>
<p>plate wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of the
</p>
<p>blown films were obtained at ambient conditions using a
</p>
<p>Philips PW1720 X-ray generator. Four layers of each of
</p>
<p>the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown film (based on 1-butene,</p>

</div><div><p>1-hexene and 1-octene) were carefully aligned and stacked
</p>
<p>on the sample holder to obtain sufficient scattering intensity
</p>
<p>for exposure of the WAXS pattern at 40 kV, 20 mA and 4 h.
</p>
<p>The sample to imaging plate distance was 5 cm. The X-ray
</p>
<p>beam was parallel to the normal of the sample plane.
</p>
<p>Pin-hole collimated small-angle X-ray scattering
</p>
<p>(SAXS) profiles of compression molded films were
</p>
<p>collected at ambient temperature using a Rigaku Ultrax18
</p>
<p>rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and
</p>
<p>60 mA. A pyrolytic graphite monochromator was used to
</p>
<p>filter out all radiation except the Cu Ka doublet, with an
</p>
<p>average wavelength of 1.5418 A&#778;. The camera used 200, 100
</p>
<p>and 300 nm pinholes for X-ray collimation. Two-dimen-
</p>
<p>sional data sets were collected using a molecular metrology
</p>
<p>2D multi-wire area detector, located ca. 65 cm from the
</p>
<p>sample. After azimuthal averaging, the raw data was
</p>
<p>corrected for detector noise, absorption, and background
</p>
<p>noise. The data were then placed on an absolute scale using
</p>
<p>a type 2 glassy carbon sample 1.07 mm thickness,
</p>
<p>previously calibrated at the advanced photon source at the
</p>
<p>Argonne National Laboratory, as a secondary standard. All
</p>
<p>the SAXS profiles presented have been masked in the low
</p>
<p>scattering vector region where the beam stop influenced the
</p>
<p>profiles.
</p>
<p>Refractive index measurements were conducted at
</p>
<p>ambient conditions on all the compression molded films
</p>
<p>and the 25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films using a Metricon
</p>
<p>Prism coupler Model 2010 along the three coordinates.
</p>
<p>Measurements in the normal (ND), machine (MD) and
</p>
<p>transverse direction (TD) were recorded. An average of 3&#8211;5
</p>
<p>measurements was reported in each direction. Thermal
</p>
<p>behavior was investigated on a Seiko SSC/5200 DSC. The
</p>
<p>heating and cooling traces were recorded at 20 8C/min in a
</p>
<p>nitrogen-purged atmosphere to study the melting and
</p>
<p>crystallization of these samples. Small angle light scattering
</p>
<p>(SALS) patterns in the Hn configuration were recorded at
</p>
<p>ambient conditions by utilizing a He&#8211;Ne laser at 633 nm.
</p>
<p>The sample to imaging plate distance was 11 cm.
</p>
<p>Crystalline, amorphous and interfacial contents in
</p>
<p>compression molded films were estimated by analyzing
</p>
<p>the free induction decay (FID) data obtained from NMR
</p>
<p>(method described below), although Alamo et al. [26] and
</p>
<p>Mandelkern et al. [46,47] have utilized a different method
</p>
<p>involving analysis of Raman spectra on LLDPEs based on
</p>
<p>1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In the present study, all
</p>
<p>NMR measurements on compression molded films were
</p>
<p>made using an Auburn IMR analyzer operating at 20 MHz.
</p>
<p>Morphological analysis was accomplished by fitting the free
</p>
<p>induction decay (FID) to a three-component model, viz.
</p>
<p>crystalline, amorphous and interfacial. The data was
</p>
<p>obtained using a 908 pulse (2 ms), 1 s pulse delay (which
</p>
<p>was much greater than five times T1) and a 17 ms dead time
</p>
<p>to eliminate signal contamination from the probe ring down.
</p>
<p>Each FID consisted of 300 points, where each data point
</p>
<p>was sampled every 1 ms, with 160 transients acquired to
</p>
<p>improve signal-to-noise. The model utilized to fit the data</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>was based on the procedure suggested by Kristiansen [48].
</p>
<p>The signal intensity versus time for hydrogen nuclei located
</p>
<p>in the crystalline domain is represented by [49,50]:

</p>
<p>where a is related to the hydrogen&#8211;hydrogen distance and b
</p>
<p>is related to the width of Gaussian broadening. Since, a and
</p>
<p>b are associated with the crystalline domain, and more
</p>
<p>specifically a function of the hydrogen&#8211;hydrogen distance,
</p>
<p>these two parameters are expected to be constant. Therefore,
</p>
<p>a series of ten resins with densities from 0.918 to 0.960 were
</p>
<p>analyzed. The values found for a and b did not vary much
</p>
<p>and average values obtained were: aZ1.070eC05, bZ
72,940. These were used in all the fits reported in this study.
</p>
<p>The two functions C[x] and S[x] are also referred as Fresnell

<p>functions.
</p>
<p>The best fit of the signal intensity&#8211;time relationship for

<p>the hydrogen nuclei located in the non-crystalline domains,

<p>where two separate sets of values of the pre-exponential

<p>factor, A, spin&#8211;spin relaxation time, T2, and the Weilbullian
</p>
<p>factor, d, were utilized for amorphous and interfacial
</p>
<p>domains, respectively. The three equations were then solved
</p>
<p>simultaneously by putting the FID data into an Excel
</p>
<p>spreadsheet and using Microsoft Solver to find the best least
</p>
<p>squared fit between the experimental data and the model.
</p>
<p>Tensile stress&#8211;strain curves were recorded at 1 m/s on a
</p>
<p>specialized MTS system 810. The servohydraulic actuator
</p>
<p>was operated in displacement control. The force transducer
</p>
<p>(Kistler 9712B50) was mounted directly to the crosshead.
</p>
<p>The force signal was amplified with a Kistler 5010B and
</p>
<p>acquired with a Nicolet Integra oscilloscope at data
</p>
<p>acquisition rates of 10&#8211;40 kHz, depending on specimen
</p>
<p>type. The specimen geometry utilized for tensile tests was
</p>
<p>rectangular, 75!17 mm2. The distance between the jaws of
</p>
<p>the tensile tester was 10 mm. For the DENT mode,
</p>
<p>specimens of 25.4!25.4 mm2 (1!1 in.2) with ligament
</p>
<p>lengths of 1, 2 and 3 mmwere tested at 1 m/s. It is noted that
</p>
<p>for blown films, the specimens deformed in the MD
</p>
<p>direction are representative of the measurement in the TD
</p>
<p>as the crack propagates in the TD. Likewise, the samples
</p>
<p>deformed in the TD are representative of the measurements
</p>
<p>in the MD. Thus, the EWF results for blown films are
</p>
<p>reported corresponding to the direction of the propagation of
</p>
<p>the crack. For a thorough regressional analysis, at least five

<p>specimens were tested at each ligament length. Prior to</p>

</div><div><p>4. Results and discussion
</p>
<p>As can be seen in Table 1, the three copolymers (&#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217;
</p>
<p>and &#8216;O&#8217;) are essentially identical in their basic molecular
</p>
<p>and rheological characteristics. These three resins have a
</p>
<p>very similar melt flow index (1.01&#8211;1.09 g/10 min) and
</p>
<p>density (0.917&#8211;0.918 g/cm3). The number average (Mn) and
</p>
<p>weight average molecular weight (Mw) obtained from the
</p>
<p>GPC are nearly identical (43.2&#8211;44.2 and 97.9&#8211;99 kg/mol,
</p>
<p>respectively). The GPC curves for each of the three resins,
</p>
<p>as shown in Fig. 2 are also comparable. This behavior is
</p>
<p>further supported by very similar zero shear rate viscosity
</p>
<p>values (7.13&#8211;7.26 kPa s). The polydispersity (2.22&#8211;2.27),
</p>
<p>that reflects the breadth of the molecular weight distribution,
</p>
<p>and the total comonomer content (2.47&#8211;2.95 mol%), as
</p>
<p>obtained by NMR, is also very similar for each of these three
</p>
<p>resins. The NMR data also indicate the presence of small
</p>
<p>levels of ethyl branches in the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; resin (0.12 and
</p>
<p>0.15 mol%, respectively). This is due to the generation of a
</p>
<p>small level of &#8216;in situ&#8217; ethyl branches that are indistinguish-
</p>
<p>able from the ethyl branches introduced by 1-butene in the
</p>
<p>copolymerization of &#8216;B&#8217; copolymer. For the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;
</p>
<p>resins, these ethyl branches were detected by NMR in
</p>
<p>addition to the butyl and hexyl branches, respectively. Thus,</p>

</div><div><p>the total mol% reported in Table 1 reflects the total amount

<p>of short chain branches (including the very small amount of
</p>
<p>ethyl branches in addition to the butyl or hexyl branches,
</p>
<p>respectively, for the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; resins). Nevertheless, the
</p>
<p>total comononer content ([X] mol%) required to make a
</p>
<p>0.918 g/cm3 density is somewhat higher for the 1-butene
</p>
<p>copolymer than those based on 1-hexene and 1-octene. The
</p>
<p>short chain branching distribution data is plotted in Fig. 2

<p>uniform (9&#8211;11/1000 C) across the width of the molecular
</p>
<p>weight distribution. Despite some scatter at the low and
</p>
<p>high-end of the molecular weight distribution that is
</p>
<p>attributed to higher error in the measurements [44], the
</p>
<p>three copolymer resins indicate a similar SCBD. Another
</p>
<p>parameter that indicates the uniformity of the distribution of
</p>
<p>short chain branches across the MWD is the % relative
</p>
<p>monomer dispersity (%RMD) index, as determined by
</p>
<p>solution NMR [51,52]. RMD is the tendency of the
</p>
<p>comonomer units to be either &#8216;isolated&#8217; (%RMDZ100) or
</p>
<p>&#8216;clustered&#8217; (%RMD!100). The values of the three resins
</p>
<p>utilized in this study are essentially the same, viz. 99.1, 99.7
</p>
<p>and 99.3% for &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;, respectively.
</p>
<p>The information from the chemometric technique to
</p>
<p>determine the SCBD (as reported in Fig. 2) does not indicate
</p>
<p>the distribution of the short chain branches along a given
</p>
<p>polymer chain. To ascertain any difference in this
</p>
<p>distribution for the three copolymers, TREF was performed
</p>
<p>on each of the LLDPE resins. These results are provided in
</p>
<p>Fig. 3. All three resins (&#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;) possess the general
</p>
<p>comonomer distribution profile characteristic of the resins
</p>
<p>produced by single site metallocene catalysts [53,54]. In the
</p>

<p>of &#8216;branched&#8217; fraction made up of polymer molecules of

<p>various comonomer contents are also observed [55].
</p>
<p>However, the absence of the low temperature peaks (in
</p>
<p>the range of 45&#8211;80 8C) in the TREF profiles of metallocene
</p>
<p>catalyzed LLDPE resins utilized in this study indicate a
</p>
<p>homogenous incorporation of the short chain comonomer in
</p>
<p>the linear ethylene backbone as compared to resins
</p>
<p>synthesized by Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts. A closer inspection
</p>
<p>of the three profiles in Fig. 3 indicates some differences that
</p>
<p>are most likely attributable to some level of difference in the
</p>
<p>SCB distribution (along a given polymer chain) among the
</p>
<p>three copolymers utilized in this study. These differences
</p>
<p>show that resin &#8216;B&#8217; has the most homogeneous crystal-
</p>
<p>lizability/solubility behavior in comparison to &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;.
</p>
<p>These differences were primarily manifested in the &#8216;second
</p>
<p>heating&#8217; DSC results on blown and compression molded
</p>
<p>films (results discussed in detail later, Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)),
</p>
<p>where the presence of a low temperature shoulder on the
</p>
<p>melting endotherms of &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; in comparison to &#8216;B&#8217; was
</p>
<p>observed. This difference in the second melting DSC
</p>
<p>behavior of &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; in comparison to &#8216;B&#8217; could arise
</p>
<p>from the slightly more homogenous distribution of SCB
</p>
<p>(along the ethylene backbone) in &#8216;B&#8217; than &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;, as
</p>
<p>indicated by TREF profiles. However, the SCBD data in
</p>
<p>Fig. 2 and the near 100% RMD values of the three resins
</p>
<p>indicate that the overall or average SCB distribution across
</p>
<p>the MWD is in fact very similar for all three copolymers.
</p>
<p>Hence, we believe that the magnitude of any differences that
</p>
<p>may be observed in physical properties (discussed later)
</p>
<p>cannot simply be attributed to this difference in the TREF
</p>
<p>profiles.
</p>
<p>The refractive index data on compression molded and
</p>
<p>25 mm (1 mil) thick blown films is listed in Table 2. As can
</p>
<p>be observed, within a given series (be it quenched, slow
</p>
<p>cooled or blown) the average refractive index for the three
</p>
<p>resins is essentially the same. As expected, the average
</p>
<p>refractive indices of the slow cooled films are somewhat
</p>
<p>higher than the corresponding quenched and blown films.
</p>
<p>For the blown films, the refractive index was observed to be
</p>
<p>slightly higher in the MD than that in TD, as might also be
</p>
<p>expected. The difference in the refractive indices in the MD</p>

<p>plane birefringence, Dn. These are listed as well in the
</p>
<p>extreme right in Table 2. The small values of Dn do not
</p>
<p>indicate a high level of orientation along the MD (in
</p>
<p>comparison to that in TD) in these films. The out-of-plane
</p>
<p>birefringence, nMDKnND, is 0.0013, 0.0011 and 0.0015 for
</p>
<p>&#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; blown films, respectively. These values are
</p>
<p>comparable to the in-plane birefringence, thereby indicating
</p>
<p>a slight uniaxial orientation for these blown films. The
</p>
<p>WAXS patterns taken with the beam parallel to the sample
</p>
<p>film normal are shown in Fig. 4. The intensities of the
</p>
<p>(1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections show some azimuthal
</p>
<p>dependence, as expected. In particular, the (200) reflections
</p>
<p>are slightly lower in intensity at the equator than that at the
</p>
<p>meridian, thereby indicating a low a-axis orientation along
</p>
<p>the MD. This is a common observation for polyethylene
</p>
<p>blown films produced at low stress levels. As expected, the
</p>
<p>(110) plane reflections, on the other hand, have a relatively
</p>
<p>lower meridianal intensity than that observed equatorially.
</p>
<p>Returning to the refractive index data in Table 2, the
</p>
<p>density of the films from the average refractive index was
</p>
<p>calculated by the following relationship [56]:
</p>
<p>rZ

</p>
<p>where rZ0.3278. From the density of the samples, the %

</p>
<p>relationship:

<p>%Xc Z

<p>where r is the sample density, ra is the density of 100%
</p>
<p>amorphous polyethylene and rc is the density of 100%
</p>
<p>crystalline PE. The values of ra and rc were taken as 0.85
</p>
<p>and 1 g/cm3 [57], respectively. The density and %Xc for all
</p>
<p>the LLDPE films are listed in Table 2. For the samples in a

</p>
<p>films (based on &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;) had essentially the same

<p>density and consequently %Xc within limits of experimental

<p>indicated that the content of these phases was very similar

<p>molded samples (Fig. 6). For the compression molded

<p>quenched samples, the weight fractions of crystalline,

<p>interfacial and amorphous domains are ca. 59.5, 29.8 and
</p>
<p>11.3%, respectively, in &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; films, while the

<p>respective values for the compression molded slow cooled

<p>are 63.1, 24.5 and 12.7%. The calculated crystalline content

<p>in the slow cooled films is larger than for the quenched

<p>films, as expected. However, the interfacial content in the
</p>
<p>slow cooled films is slightly less than that in the quenched
</p>
<p>films, although the amorphous content is very similar in
</p>
<p>both the compression molded series. In general, the values
</p>
<p>of crystallinity obtained from free induction decay NMR
</p>
<p>tends to be higher than those obtained from DSC. This is due
</p>
<p>to the fact that taut tie molecules can also contribute to the
</p>
<p>&#8216;rigid&#8217; phase. Very recently, Yoon et al. [58] utilized SAXS
</p>
<p>and solid-state NMR method (rotor-encoded rotational echo
</p>
<p>double resonance technique) to investigate the structure of
</p>
<p>metallocene catalyzed LLDPEs as a function of comonomer
</p>
<p>type (1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene) and content. They
</p>
<p>also did not observe any structural differences in their series

<p>of &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; materials investigated that had a ca.
</p>
<p>3 mol% comonomer content.
</p>
<p>Returning to the present study, larger scale lengths at the
</p>
<p>micro level for our materials were characterized by SALS.
</p>
<p>The spherulitic scale lengths in the compression molded
</p>
<p>quenched and slow cooled films are indicated by the Hn
</p>
<p>SALS in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the SALS patterns (within a

<p>given series, be it quenched or slow cooled), are similar for
</p>
<p>the &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;. These &#8216;four-lobed&#8217; patterns are
</p>
<p>characteristic of a spherulitic morphology. However, when
</p>
<p>comparing the patterns of the slow cooled with that of the
</p>
<p>quenched films, it appears that the slow cooled films have</p>

</div><div><p>Fig. 6. Crystalline, interfacial and amorphous contents in compression

</div><div><p>larger but less well-defined spherulitic structures than the
</p>
<p>quenched films. This was also supported by the surface
</p>
<p>analysis of these films by scanning electron microscopy
</p>
<p>(SEM) (results not shown here). The SALS patterns in the
</p>
<p>Hn configuration can be utilized to calculate the average size
</p>
<p>of the spherulites by use of the following relationship
</p>
<p>[59&#8211;61]:

</p>
<p>where R, is the radius of the spherulites, lm is the
</p>
<p>wavelength in the scattering medium and qmax is the angle
</p>
<p>of intensity maxima in one of the lobes of the Hn pattern.
</p>
<p>The calculated diameter for the quenched films was in the
</p>
<p>range of 2.9&#8211;3.6 mm (B&#8211;Q: 3.3 mm, H&#8211;Q: 2.9 mm and O&#8211;Q:
</p>
<p>3.6 mm) whereas the slow cooled films were in the range of
</p>
<p>3.8&#8211;4.2 mm (B&#8211;SC: 3.8 mm, H&#8211;SC: 4.2 mm and O&#8211;SC:
</p>
<p>4.2 mm). As expected, the size of the spherulites in the slow
</p>
<p>cooled films is larger than that in quenched films.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SEM analysis on these films indicated a
</p>
<p>broad distribution of sizes (data not shown).
</p>
<p>The first and second DSC heating&#8211;cooling profiles of the
</p>
<p>blown films are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The
</p>
<p>first heating (Fig. 8(a)) is extremely comparable for each of
</p>
<p>the three, &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; blown films, with melting
</p>
<p>transition peaks in the range of 117&#8211;119 8C. The first
</p>
<p>cooling curves indicate a lower temperature primary
</p>
<p>crystallization exotherm peak for &#8216;B&#8217; (93 8C) than the &#8216;H&#8217;
</p>
<p>(95.5 8C), which in turn is slightly lower than &#8216;O&#8217; (96.5 8C).
</p>
<p>It might be postulated that a lower primary crystallization
</p>
<p>temperature peak (higher effective degree of undercooling)
</p>
<p>indicates crystallization of relatively smaller-sized crystals
</p>
<p>as compared to the sample that crystallized at a higher
</p>
<p>temperature. The slightly smaller-sized lamellar crystals
</p>
<p>should therefore begin to melt at a lower temperature. This
</p>
<p>is confirmed by the endotherm peak positions in the second
</p>
<p>heating cycles, where &#8216;B&#8217; shows the peak endotherm at
</p>
<p>116.5 8C whereas &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; show the second melting
</p>
<p>endotherm peaks at 117.5 8C. The second heating profiles
</p>
<p>are shown in Fig. 8(b). A distinct &#8216;shoulder&#8217; in the second
</p>
<p>cycle melting endotherm at 109&#8211;113 8C for the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;
</p>
<p>films (Fig. 8(b)) can be clearly seen in comparison to the &#8216;B&#8217;
</p>
<p>film, which does not show a distinct shoulder. This
</p>
<p>difference in the second melting DSC behavior of &#8216;H&#8217; and
</p>
<p>&#8216;O&#8217; in comparison to &#8216;B&#8217; could arise from the more
</p>
<p>interchain homogeneity of SCB in &#8216;B&#8217; than &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;, as
</p>
<p>indicated by TREF profiles in Fig. 3. Another noticeable and
</p>
<p>identical feature in the first and second cooling curves is the
</p>
<p>presence of a small exotherm transition at 63 8C for each of
</p>
<p>the three films within a given series, be it blown, quenched
</p>
<p>or slow cooled. This secondary crystallization is postulated
</p>
<p>to lead to the formation of a second population of lamellar
</p>
<p>crystals that are thinner than those formed during the
</p>
<p>primary crystallization process at higher temperatures.

</p>
<p>Based on the first heating curves (Fig. 9(a)), the melting
</p>
<p>peaks of the quenched and slow cooled films are in the range
</p>
<p>of 115&#8211;117 8C. Only the slow cooled films of &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;

</p>
<p>These samples were left in the insulated DSC chamber and
</p>
<p>allowed to cool down to room temperature in about 2 h after
</p>
<p>which they were heated again and the corresponding second
</p>
<p>heating curves were recorded (Fig. 9(b)). As can be seen, a
</p>
<p>behavior similar to what was observed for the blown films is
</p>
<p>noted. Specifically, the presence of a &#8216;shoulder&#8217; on the
</p>
<p>melting endotherms of &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; (for both quenched and

<p>samples were cooled very slowly after the first melting (as
</p>
<p>against a cooling rate of 20 8C/min for the blown films). As
</p>
<p>stated earlier, the slightly broader first melting endotherms

</p>
<p>can be said that the thermal behavior based on the first

<p>heating responses of these films &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; (be it
</p>
<p>quenched or blown) are very similar. In the compression

</p>
<p>the mechanical properties at slow deformation rates of these
</p>
<p>films will become clear in the following discussion.
</p>
<p>The tensile properties of the 25 mm thick blown films and
</p>
<p>compression molded films that were measured at slow draw
</p>
<p>rates, ca. 0.0004&#8211;0.008 m/s, (25&#8211;510 mm/min) are shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10. The yield and breaking strength are essentially the
</p>
<p>same for the films based on &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; in each
</p>
<p>direction (MD or TD). For the LLDPE blown films, due to
</p>
<p>preferential orientation of the lamellar crystals, the TD
</p>
<p>modulus tends to be higher than the MD modulus [13].
</p>
<p>However, for the films investigated here, the low levels of
</p>
<p>orientation translates to the modulus being only marginally
</p>
<p>higher along the TD. Likewise, the tensile properties of the
</p>
<p>compression molded films (Fig. 10(b)) at conventional draw
</p>
<p>rates indicate very comparable yield and breaking strengths
</p>
<p>for films based on &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;, within a given series.
</p>
<p>Within the limits of error, the tensile modulus is also very
</p>
<p>similar for films based on three resins in each series. These
</p>
<p>results clearly indicate that the slight differences in the
</p>
<p>TREF profiles in Fig. 3 and differences in first melting DSC
</p>
<p>profiles of compression molded slow cooled films really do
</p>
<p>not play any role in governing the mechanical properties

<p>shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b) for 25 mm thick blown and

<p>and all fall in the range of 17&#8211;20 MPa. The &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;
</p>
<p>blown films also show a higher breaking strain than that for

<p>corresponding &#8216;B&#8217; films (Fig. 11(a)). Likewise, B&#8211;Q and

<p>observed in the breaking strengths. The breaking strength of

<p>the 1-butene based films (&#8216;B&#8217;) is distinctly lower than that
</p>
<p>for the 1-hexene (&#8216;H&#8217;) and 1-octene (&#8216;O&#8217;) based films,</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>regardless of film type (quenched, slow cooled or blown).
</p>
<p>For the blown films, the &#8216;B&#8217; films have a breaking strength
</p>
<p>of ca. 21&#8211;24 MPa as compared to that of 31&#8211;36 MPa for &#8216;H&#8217;
</p>
<p>and &#8216;O&#8217; films. In either direction (MD or TD) the &#8216;H&#8217; and
</p>
<p>&#8216;O&#8217; films also show distinctly greater strain hardening when
</p>
<p>compared to the &#8216;B&#8217; films, and this accounts for the higher
</p>
<p>values of the breaking strengths. Similarly, strain hardening
</p>
<p>can be observed in the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; compression molded
</p>
<p>films. The quenched and slow cooled films of &#8216;B&#8217; do not
</p>
<p>undergo any strain hardening and display much lower
</p>
<p>breaking strengths (6&#8211;10 MPa) as compared to the high
</p>
<p>values of the &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; films (16&#8211;26 MPa). Note that
</p>
<p>when the breaking strengths of the compression molded and
</p>
<p>blown films corresponding to the same resin are compared,
</p>
<p>the blown films have superior properties. Comparing the

<p>results in Figs. 9 and 10, it can be inferred that the breaking

<p>strength of blown films of &#8216;B&#8217; is lower than that of &#8216;H&#8217; and

<p>the total deformation to failure (plotted on the secondary

</p>
<p>indicating an increased ductile failure in &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;. This
</p>
<p>was also confirmed visually by the fact that the deformed
</p>
<p>&#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; samples had a longer and ductile sleeve
</p>
<p>(relative to that in &#8216;B&#8217;) that emanated from the region where
</p>
<p>the mechanically driven tup exited the sample. This is also

<p>reflected as higher total rupture energies for &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;
</p>
<p>(55&#8211;61 J) than &#8216;B&#8217; (30&#8211;37 J). However, in all these tests,
</p>
<p>viz. dart impact, Spencer impact and Elmendorf Tear the
</p>
<p>rate of deformation of the films is not well-defined. In a dart
</p>
<p>impact measurement, a falling dart ruptures the film held in
</p>
<p>tension and the equivalent force to rupture is recorded in
</p>
<p>terms of the mass of the falling dart. In the case of the
</p>
<p>Spencer impact strength measurements, a piece of film is</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>held in tension and punctured with a hemispherical head
</p>
<p>attached to a swinging pendulum whereas in Elmendorf tear
</p>
<p>resistance, the precut film sample is ruptured by a swinging
</p>
<p>pendulum. In the puncture resistance measurements the
</p>
<p>sample is held in tension and punctured by a pneumatically
</p>
<p>driven tup/dart. In either configuration, the deformation rate
</p>
<p>of the film can be visualized to be a maximum at the
</p>
<p>initiation (when the pendulum or the ball/dart hits the film)
</p>
<p>and then decreases thereafter as the crack progresses (as
</p>
<p>most of the energy carried by the pendulum or the ball/dart
</p>
<p>has already been spent in overcoming the initial resistance).
</p>
<p>Thus, the rates of deformation (reported above) are at best
</p>
<p>estimates and never an exact value, as the deformation
</p>
<p>process of the samples is not well-controlled.
</p>
<p>To characterize the deformation of the films in a more
</p>
<p>well-defined extensional regime, tear resistance properties
</p>
<p>were measured by utilizing the essential work of fracture
</p>
<p>(recall earlier discussion of this methodology). Here, precut

<p>The tear specimens satisfy the plane stress conditions [Eqs.

<p>(3) and (4) in Section 2] and fail right after the yield and do
</p>
<p>not undergo any plastic stretching that is characteristic of
</p>
<p>the samples in a conventional tensile deformation test.
</p>
<p>Further, the larger ligament length specimens had a larger
</p>
<p>strain at break. This is due to the fact that at larger ligament
</p>
<p>lengths, there is more material in the ligament that
</p>
<p>undergoes deformation in comparison to that in the smaller
</p>
<p>ligament lengths. However, the yield stress is practically the

<p>displacement curves were obtained in a similar fashion for
</p>
<p>the 25 mm thick blown films of &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; and all the

<p>compression molded films. Based on the procedure outlined

<p>in Section 2, the specific fracture energy, obtained by</p>

</div><div>
</div><div><p>integrating the stress&#8211;strain curve, was fitted by a linear
</p>
<p>relationship when plotted against the ligament length. The
</p>
<p>intercepts of these plots, then gave the essential work of
</p>
<p>fracture. These results are shown in Fig. 16. For the blown
</p>
<p>films (Fig. 16(a)) in each of the direction (MD or TD), the
</p>
<p>essential work of fracture is observed to increase with
</p>
<p>increasing short chain branch length, a result consistent with
</p>
<p>the impact strength and Elmendorf tear resistance measure-
</p>
<p>ments. As stated before, when a blown film specimen is
</p>
<p>stretched along the MD, the crack propagates along the TD.
</p>
<p>Therefore, when the specimen is being stretched along the
</p>
<p>MD, the measured EWF is representative of the TD
</p>
<p>direction. Consequently, the EWF along the TD is greater
</p>
<p>than that along the MD. This is consistent with the tear
</p>
<p>resistance being greater along the TD than along the MD
</p>
<p>(Fig. 13(a)), which in turn is a manifestation of the preferred
</p>
<p>lamellar orientation [13,14] (although only slight in this
</p>
<p>study). For the compression molded quenched films
</p>
<p>(Fig. 16(b)), the essential work of fracture of films based
</p>
<p>on 1-butene was also observed to be less than that of the
</p>
<p>1-hexene and 1-octene films. However, within the limits of
</p>
<p>experimental error, the EWF results of the slow cooled films
</p>
<p>do not indicate a strong dependence on the short chain</p>

</p>
<p>can be inferred that the mechanical properties of the films of
</p>
<p>the three essentially identical linear low density polyethy-
</p>
<p>lene copolymers based on 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene
</p>
<p>show a dependence on the length of short chain branch only
</p>
<p>at high rates of deformation. This is summarized in Table 3,
</p>
<p>where at slower rates of deformation, the mechanical
</p>
<p>properties were observed to be similar but quite different at
</p>
<p>higher deformation rates. This is due to the fact that these
</p>
<p>films are very similar in their molecular, rheological and
</p>
<p>structural aspects that any effects due to the different short
</p>
<p>chain lengths (present in small amounts of ca. 2.5&#8211;3 mol%)
</p>
<p>do not get reflected at slower deformation rates. However, at
</p>
<p>high deformation rates, these effects become prominent
</p>
<p>such that the mechanical properties of films based on
</p>
<p>1-butene were observed to be lower than those based on
</p>
<p>1-hexene and 1-octene. Recalling that the primary objective
</p>
<p>of this study was to further investigate the effect of the
</p>
<p>length of short chain branch on the physical properties of
</p>
<p>LLDPEs, the results presented here have shown that the
</p>
<p>length of the short chain branch does play an important role
</p>
<p>in influencing the mechanical properties of the LLDPEs in
</p>
<p>agreement with earlier results [28] and furthermore
</p>
<p>established that this effect is pronounced only at high rates
</p>
<p>of deformation.
</p>
<p>With regards to the origin of the effect of the difference in
</p>
<p>short chain branch length on the mechanical properties
</p>
<p>when measured at high rates of deformation, it seems
</p>
<p>difficult to attribute this to the amorphous phase in view of
</p>
<p>the low mole percentage of the branches and the fact that the
</p>
<p>rheological behavior of at least the melt state shows no
</p>
<p>significant differences. We did investigate the DMA
</p>
<p>(dynamic mechanical analysis) behavior of the film
</p>
<p>materials (data not shown) but did not find any distinct
</p>
<p>variations between the materials although we admit that the
</p>
<p>DMA tests were determined in the lower frequency range
</p>
<p>(0.001&#8211;10 Hz). We conjecture that the origin of the effect of
</p>
<p>the difference in short chain branch length on the
</p>
<p>mechanical properties is coupled to its influence on the
</p>
<p>deformation behavior of the crystalline phase. It has been
</p>
<p>speculated [21,24,62,63] that a short chain branch prevents
</p>
<p>the formation of crystalline regions in its immediate vicinity
</p>
<p>leading to an increased probability of the main chain to
</p>
<p>which it is attached to be incorporated into two different</p>

</p>
<p>bridge or a tie molecule. If this supposition is true, then the
</p>
<p>enhanced properties, associated with plastic deformation
</p>
<p>(ductility, toughness, tear resistance, etc.), could be due to
</p>
<p>an increasing number of tie molecules with increasing molar
</p>
<p>content of short chain branches. However, this postulate
</p>
<p>does not explain the EWF results on slow cooled films
</p>
<p>where the essential work of fracture was not observed to be
</p>
<p>strongly dependent on the branch length. For the three series
</p>
<p>of films investigated in this study, viz. the blown, quenched
</p>
<p>and slow cooled, the latter had the slowest rate of
</p>
<p>crystallization and hence the highest opportunity to form a

<p>more thermodynamically desirable equilibrium structure.
</p>
<p>Thus, if tie molecule formation is favored at longer branch

<p>lengths that consequently result in larger values of strength,
</p>
<p>then this effect (&#8216;O&#8217;w&#8216;H&#8217;O&#8216;B&#8217;) should be more pro-
</p>
<p>nounced in the EWF results on slow cooled in comparison to

<p>blown and quenched films. However, this is not the case.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is difficult to envision the increased formation
</p>
<p>of tie molecules with increasing short chain branch length.
</p>
<p>We, however, postulate that during the process of
</p>
<p>deformation at high rates (1 m/s), the length of the short
</p>
<p>chain branch may play an important role when it is pulled
</p>
<p>into and potentially through the chain folded lamellar
</p>
<p>regions as they deform. A very simplified schematic of this
</p>
<p>concept is shown in Fig. 17. The magnitude of the resistance
</p>
<p>offered by a shorter branch length undergoing deformation
</p>
<p>through the crystalline regions could be lower than that
</p>
<p>experienced by a longer branch length. Furthermore, for
</p>
<p>LLDPEs that have only a few mol% (!5 mol%) of the short
</p>
<p>chain branch comonomer, it is possible that this effect would
</p>
<p>be pronounced at higher rates of deformation. This is
</p>
<p>because at lower rates (0.0004 m/s) of deformation the
</p>
<p>polymer chains have a longer time scale to respond to the
</p>
<p>deformation, and consequently the resistance offered by
</p>
<p>the branch during deformation may be independent of its
</p>
<p>length. However, while this explanation is a hypothesis that
</p>
<p>might explain the observed phenomena, it is yet to be
</p>
<p>confirmed. Future investigations need to be conducted to
</p>
<p>gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of
</p>
<p>deformation and their rate dependence at the molecular
</p>
<p>level.
</p>
<p>In the past, some attempts to investigate the slow crack
</p>
<p>growth in polyethylenes have been conducted, [64&#8211;66]</p>

</div><div><p>5. Summary
</p>
<p>Three LLDPE resins synthesized by a single site
</p>
<p>metallocene catalyst using 1-butene, 1-hexene, and
</p>
<p>1-octene as co-monomers were characterized to be
</p>
<p>essentially identical in terms of their molecular weight
</p>
<p>and distribution melt rheology, density, crystallinity, and
</p>
<p>short chain branching content. The resins were also very
</p>
<p>homogenous with respect to the short chain branch
</p>
<p>distribution across their MWD, although very slight
</p>
<p>differences were observed in the TREF profiles of the
</p>
<p>three resins. Therefore, this sample set allows us to evaluate
</p>
<p>the exclusive influence exerted by the short chain branch
</p>
<p>length on the physical properties of the resulting films;
</p>
<p>many previous attempts by other workers to accomplish
</p>
<p>the same objective have been confounded by samples
</p>
<p>that differed substantially in their chemical composition.

</div><div>
</div><div><p>(slow-cooled and quenched) films as well as blown films of
</p>
<p>the subject LLDPEs were investigated using a variety of
</p>
<p>tests carried out at widely differing deformation rates. The
</p>
<p>blown films made from these resins had low levels of
</p>
<p>equivalent in-plane birefringence and the flat plate WAXS
</p>
<p>measurements indicated low a-axis orientation along the
</p>
<p>MD (Keller&#8211;Machin low stress row structure). Within the
</p>
<p>compression molded quenched and slow cooled series,
</p>
<p>the lamellar and spherulitic scale lengths as determined by
</p>
<p>SAXS and SALS indicated very similar dimensions
</p>
<p>corresponding to &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;. The blown and
</p>
<p>compression molded films formed from these resins were
</p>
<p>also found to be similar to each other (within a given series,
</p>
<p>be it blown, quenched or slow cooled) in terms of
</p>
<p>crystallinity, and overall crystallization characteristics,
</p>
<p>although, slightly broader melting endotherms of &#8216;H&#8217; and
</p>
<p>&#8216;O&#8217; in comparison to &#8216;B&#8217; were observed in the first melting
</p>
<p>profiles of compression molded slow cooled films.
</p>
<p>However, the tensile properties of slow cooled &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217;
</p>
<p>and &#8216;O&#8217;at slow deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min) were
</p>
<p>very similar, thereby clearly indicating that these slight
</p>
<p>differences in the TREF behavior and differences in first
</p>
<p>melting DSC profiles of compression molded slow cooled
</p>
<p>films really do not play any role in governing the final
</p>
<p>mechanical properties of the LLDPE films obtained at
</p>
<p>slower deformation rates (up to 510 mm/min).
</p>
<p>At higher deformation rates (1 m/s), however, the
</p>
<p>breaking strength was observed to increase with increasing
</p>
<p>short chain branch length for all the samples investigated
</p>
<p>(blown, quenched and slow cooled). This is consistent with
</p>
<p>an earlier study [28] utilizing the same polymers and films</p>

</div><div><p>investigated here, where the impact and tear strength of
</p>
<p>blown films based on 1-octene and 1-hexene were found to
</p>
<p>be considerably better than those of films based on 1-butene.
</p>
<p>While the deformation rates in the above mentioned tests are
</p>
<p>quite high, the rates change considerably during the
</p>
<p>measurement. Therefore, the deformation characteristics
</p>
<p>of the subject films were also studied in a well-defined and
</p>
<p>controlled regime by analyzing the essential work of
</p>
<p>fracture for the blown and compressed films. For the
</p>
<p>blown films, the essential work of fracture was found to
</p>
<p>increase systematically with increasing short chain branch
</p>
<p>length. For the compression molded films, the 1-hexene and
</p>
<p>1-octene based films performed better than the 1-butene
</p>
<p>films. In general, the mechanical properties of 1-octene
</p>
<p>based systems were somewhat enhanced relative to those
</p>
<p>based on 1-hexene. However, this is not an all inclusive
</p>
<p>statement, as the compression molded films of &#8216;O&#8217;
</p>
<p>performed equally to &#8216;H&#8217; in high speed tensile (breaking
</p>
<p>strength at 1 m/s), puncture resistance and EWF tear tests.
</p>
<p>From these results, it can be concluded that the length of the
</p>
<p>short chain branch length plays a crucial role in determining
</p>
<p>the mechanical properties of LLDPE, especially at high
</p>
<p>deformation rates. It is hypothesized that the magnitude of
</p>
<p>the resistance offered by a shorter branch length undergoing
</p>
<p>deformation through the crystalline regions could be lower
</p>
<p>than that offered by a longer branch length. However,
</p>
<p>further studies to gain a better understanding of the
</p>
<p>underlying physical process of deformation need to be
</p>
<p>conducted.</p>
